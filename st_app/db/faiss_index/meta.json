But the writing is very original and lends itself to some good social commentary that doesn't get too preachy. At least for the most part. This movie does what a lot of good animated movies do, and creates a world that is interesting and open to A LOT of visual gags. All this being said, I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of animated movies.\r\n6 likes",

Even before this week, it seemed like a simple kids movie for kids. However, Disney Animation Studios really stepped it up here, continuing to improve after Frozen and Big Hero 6. I daresay they will begin to rival Pixar soon, because Zootopia is a funny, innovative and cleverly deep film that kids and adults will enjoy.",

The story is solid, there are actual twists, good dialogue and incredibly funny jokes. The jokes for adults were laid in there really well instead of just spelling them out they laid it in as parts of the story. I laughed really hard a number of times. Very fun.
