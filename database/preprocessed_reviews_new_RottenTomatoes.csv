0.5,2026-01-15,"Zootopia is an animated movie that seems far more interested in making sure you understand its message than in trusting you to enjoy the story. From early on, the film’s allegory for racism is pushed so hard it stops being allegory and starts feeling like a checklist. Every conflict exists to reinforce the same point, and characters regularly pause the momentum to restate the moral in plain terms. There’s little room for subtext, ambiguity, or audience interpretation. If you somehow missed the message the first time, don’t worry—the movie will repeat it again, slower, and with emphasis. What’s frustrating is that the world-building and premise are genuinely clever. But instead of letting themes emerge naturally, the film insists on guiding your reaction at every step. By the second half, the messaging becomes so overt and self-satisfied that it actively hurts watchability. It’s not offensive. It’s exhausting. A movie that mistakes repetition for depth and sincerity for insight.",157,en,zootopia animated movie seems far interested making sure understand message trusting enjoy story early film allegory racism pushed hard stop allegory start feeling like checklist every conflict exists reinforce point character regularly pause momentum restate moral plain term little room subtext ambiguity audience interpretation somehow missed message first time worry movie repeat slower emphasis frustrating world building premise genuinely clever instead letting theme emerge naturally film insists guiding reaction every step second half messaging becomes overt self satisfied actively hurt watchability offensive exhausting movie mistake repetition depth sincerity insight,2026-01,89,3.719497471721893

The protagonists, Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick (Jason Bateman), are the ones who carry all the emotional and narrative weight. They bring dynamism, memorable moments, and establish the essential connection with the audience. The plot feels slow at times, yet it remains interesting and enjoyable. The humor is well integrated and works for all audiences. It is one of those animated films that clearly embraces its identity as animation: it does not aim for realism but instead defines its characteristics with precision. It conveys a clear message of personal growth, showing that even when you feel out of place, it is still possible to carve out your own path.

4.0,2025-11-17,"★★★★☆ Zootopia is that rare animated movie that works brilliantly as both a hilarious buddy-cop comedy for kids and a surprisingly sharp, layered allegory about prejudice, systemic bias, and the danger of fear-based politics for adults. The world-building is absolutely off the charts: a sprawling, fully realized metropolis where every district (from icy Tundratown to rainy Rainforest District) feels alive, detailed, and logically designed for animals of every size. The gag density is insane (the sloth DMV scene is still one of the funniest things ever animated), and the action sequences (especially the naturalist club chase and the climactic train fight) are genuinely thrilling. Judy Hopps is an all-timer protagonist: tiny, relentlessly optimistic, and forced to confront her own unconscious biases in ways that feel honest and earned. Nick Wilde’s slow journey from cynical hustler to proud cop is pure charm, and Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman have chemistry that leaps off the screen. Shakira’s ""Try Everything"" over the end credits still gives goosebumps every single time. It loses half a star only because the third-act ""big twist"" is a little convoluted and the villain’s motive feels a touch undercooked compared to the rest of the film’s nuance. Four stars: one for the laughs, one for the heart, one for the world you never want to leave, and one because it somehow made a story about predator-prey relations feel urgently relevant without ever preaching. Smart, gorgeous, endlessly rewatchable comfort food with a brain. 8/10.

5.0,2025-06-01,I absolutely love this movie from start to finish and everything in between now don't get me wrong there might be a few moments here and there where I may not have particularly liked it for one reason or another. But it was only a mild dislike not hate or certainly not enraging. I can't say this for many movies I watched over the years with of course a few exceptions. The Lion King that's been my most favorite and top Disney movie of all time for many many years and still is I couldn't tell you how many times I watched that movie when I was a child and while I was growing up in my teens and adult years. But besides the point rarely do I find or barely at all do I find a movie that I find myself attached to or especially rewatching it more than once and though I cannot recount how many times I watched The Lion King. I can certainly tell you wholeheartedly without a doubt since I kept track from the first time I watch zootopia. I watched the movie in total of 16 times plus more. The plus more is for when I'm most certainly am going to be rewatching this movie again and again because I do not get sick and tired of it. Just like my beloved favorite Disney movie of The Lion King. But of course the amount of times you watch a movie does not make it the best movie. But rather it's the enjoyment and sense of comfort you get while watching the movie and I most certainly felt that and more. I felt even with my lackluster skills I can do something and make something big of myself. That I can improve and get better over time and that no matter how hard the obstacles get I will be able to get through them as long as I have a positive attitude and focus on the things I can do rather on the things I can't. And that is just one of many examples on how I felt when I was watching zootopia. How it's encourage me and how it's made me realize I had that special something within me the whole time I just never bothered to look and check if it was there. In any case I digress the point is I truly love this movie it's a masterpiece all in its own right and I truly look forward to and also excited for zootopia 2 coming on the way. And I most certainly will be recommending this movie to children and to my family and friends. P.S to those that worked on the movie of zootopia as well as those that we're doing the voice acting I truly thank you from the bottom of my heart for making such a wonderful movie. Also even though Lion King will forever be my most favorite top Disney movie I am happy to say officially zootopia has taken that top spot so before Lion King for me was number one and always will remain number one. But now the number one is zootopia and that will not change no matter what movies come after and even though now The Lion King is now second it certainly is not any less the best.,557,en,absolutely love movie start finish everything get wrong might moment may particularly liked one reason another mild dislike hate certainly enraging say many movie watched year course exception lion king favorite top disney movie time many many year still tell many time watched movie child growing teen adult year besides point rarely find barely find movie find attached especially rewatching though cannot recount many time watched lion king certainly tell wholeheartedly without doubt since kept track first time watch zootopia watched movie total time plus plus certainly going rewatching movie get sick tired like beloved favorite disney movie lion king course amount time watch movie make best movie rather enjoyment sense comfort get watching movie certainly felt felt even lackluster skill something make something big improve get better time matter hard obstacle get able get long positive attitude focus thing rather thing one many example felt watching zootopia encourage made realize special something within whole time never bothered look check case digress point truly love movie masterpiece right truly look forward also excited zootopia coming way certainly recommending movie child family friend p worked movie zootopia well voice acting truly thank bottom heart making wonderful movie also even though lion king forever favorite top disney movie happy say officially zootopia taken top spot lion king number one always remain number one number one zootopia change matter movie come even though lion king second certainly less best,2025-06,236,3.9862913192122207

3.5,2024-11-21,"""Zootopia"" is a very fun movie. The movie has something for everyone, whether they like the police action, the animal characters, the hardworking main character or the comedic paring of the two leads. I would have likely loved this film as a kid, I loved police stuff and this film has a lot of good police/detective material for those kids. This film has a lot of good stuff, it just loses steam as it comes to its final act. ""Zootopia"" had three different directors, that may contribute to why the film feels very disjointed. Behind the scenes there are a lot of deleted scenes and scrapped ideas, including disagreements on who the main character was going to be. These disfunctions are well hidden for the most part, until the final 30 minutes. The movie suffers from tonal whiplash as they transition from one plot point to the other.

5.0,2021-04-28,"This review contains spoilers. Zootopia is one of the most loved animated films of recent years and considered by many to be a masterpiece. I am included among them. I've seen it at least 5 times, but each time it remains a perfectly aimed film. The animations are spectacular and from 10 and praise: the hairs are treated in detail and the areas of the city are memorable. Even in the characters sector we only have iconic characters: Nick is my favorite, well characterized and with a poignant background. Judy is a great protagonist and with a beautiful story arc.

There's a modicum of comedy, a dose of mystery and an underdog component but no facet of the movie is fantastic.

5.0,2020-12-04,"The Best Film Of The Year, So Far. From the studio that brought you Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen & Big Hero 6, Zootopia surfaces as a highly original, incredibly refreshing, thoroughly engaging, surprisingly timely & delightfully subversive beast fable about prejudice & stereotype that not only marks a new creative high for Disney but is arguably the finest film that this legendary animation studio has come up with in their Revival Era, so far. Set in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, the story of Zootopia takes place in the titular metropolis and follows a bunny cop named Judy Hopps who, despite her par excellent performance in the class, is assigned parking duty by her superior. But when she volunteers to undertake a missing-predator case, she is given 48 hours to solve the mystery or resign, following which she blackmails a sly fox into helping her, and uncovers a sinister conspiracy. Co-directed by Byron Howard & Rich Moore, the duo put up an intriguing world on the screen that does have a fresh quality but there is still a deep sense of familiarity to it. However, where the two leave a lasting impression is in finding that perfect balance between its consistently gripping storyline & moments of pure hilarity. The writing staff also deserves a mention, for their screenplay brims with numerous pop culture references, parodies many renowned classics & handles its topical themes with care. The 3D animation is absolutely top-notch, for the images retain its crispness, clarity & vibrancy from beginning to end. The animators put up a vast number of characters on the screen, ranging from the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, yet they are all given a well-defined arc. Cinematography further enhances the overall look n feel of the story with its fluid camera-work, splendid use of colour palette & spot-on lighting. Editing provides just enough screen time to all the relevant characters while moving the plot forward at a blistering pace. The cast is wisely chosen, and all the actors do a competent job in lending their voice & soul to the mammals they play. Ginnifer Goodwin brings a bubbly side to the new cop in town and confidently plays her role. Jason Bateman plays his part with finesse plus his voice really fits his cynical con artist character. Also, the chemistry between the two is a highlight in itself. Michael Giacchino's ebullient score seamlessly blends in & compliments the narrative while Shakira beautifully wraps everything up with a catchy, uplifting & wonderful song that smartly summarises its themes & message. On an overall scale, Zootopia finds Disney stepping out of its comfort zone to tackle a bold, ambitious & risky project, and it is one gamble that pays off tremendously well in the studio's favour. Also, its arrival couldn't have been better, considering how its elements of prejudice & stereotypes mirror the racial hostilities present in our very own current social environment. An ingenious blend of sophisticated storytelling, jubilant humour & thought-provoking themes that amazes, entertains & enlightens without ever compromising with the fun factor, Zootopia is a definite delight for viewers of all ages, and is undoubtedly the best film of the year, so far.

The pacing was good, the main characters were solid, the voice acting was fantastic, there was some good humour, and there were various entertaining references to other films like The Godfather. However, the villain was another twist villain just like in Big Hero 6 - Disney seems to love twist villains now, even though they don't work well.

The characters are very likeable and share great chemistry thanks to the film's stellar cast and screenwriting. Jason Bateman as the fast-talking fox con-artist Nick Wilde stole the show for me with his snarky comedic timing and unexpected emotional resonance that's peeled away like an onion as the movie goes on. The movie takes n interesting approach with its heavy and relevant themes of racial prejudice.

The computer animation here is gorgeous with sprawling ecosystems, incredible animal designs (the fur on Hopps and Wilde look impressive on a 4K screen), and clever set designs for an urban area made for many different types and sizes of creatures. On surface level, without thinking too much about the themes, it also works as a crime/mystery film about Officer Hopps discovering why some animals seem to be going back to their ""biological tendencies"" whilst teaming up with an unlikely partner. Additionally, the moments where Hopps and Wilde's friendship gets hurt and repaired hit those Disney emotional beats that are sure to make you teary eyed then so heartwarming.

But the messages aren't the only good things about this movie.

I loved the messages, all the unexpected twist (yes, indeed there were, for me, unexpected twist in this kind of predictable movie), the characters, the look of it all, ugh, I just loved it. Okay, so it's about this world where animals (predators and prey) live amongst each other in peace. There is a bunny called Judy Hopps and she dreams big. She wants to be the fist bunny cop and while no one believes in her, she believes in herself. And yes, she end up becoming a cop. But because she is a bunny she gets to do the not so fun job. Until one day she gets 48 hours to solve a missing Otter crime. She gets help from a fox ""criminal"" called Nick Wilde. They take on the adventure together, and through the ups and downs they find the guilty party and learn valuable lessons. One of the things I adored in this movie is the messages. Which is, even if everybody disencourge you, you have to believe in yourself and go get what you want or become who you want to be. I think that's one great messages and I really believe kids and even grown ups can learn a lot from it. The message was pretty clear throughout the whole movie, so that was great as well. Also, The movie is so well made. All the different areas in Zootopia were all so unique and beautifully crafted. They really did a great job. The humor in this movie was amazing. The film started and I was already laughing. The voice actors were chosen very well, they really brought life to the characters and their emotions.

Everything from the setting to the characters contributes to this real life comparison of racism and honestly it works soooo well! I don't even mind that the entire film felt slightly too present day with the iphones and technology, because the way this film is set up, is that it is telling a story of racism present day. Give this a few decades and it will go down as a classic guaranteed! My biggest complaint with this film is the villain at the end. There was no sign or anything that bellwether would be the villain. It felt lazily thrown in at last minute to give an evil mastermind behind the work. Her intentions line up, but still feel a little weak since honestly any prey animal could say that those were their intentions.

Like I mentioned before, it's an animated movie and it's about a fictitious mammal city called Zootopia, where a bunny wants to be a police officer. Since it's an animated movie, people just give their voice to the characters in it, and the main voices in this movie are Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. Ginnifer Goodwin is an actress that is mainly known for ""Big Love"" series and the movie I'm talking about, Zootopia and Jason Bateman is mainly known for ""Arrested development"" series, ""Bad words"" and Zootopia, also he won the Golden Globe Award for the best actor in TV series for ""Arrested development"". In the movie Ginnifer Goodwin gives her voice to Judy Hopps and Jason Bateman gives his voice to Nick Wilde. In my opinion they both did very good voices in all the movie context because the emotions in all the scenes are very clear and also the dialogs are totally understandable. The plot is about a young bunny (Judy) that wants to be a police officer when she grows up, everybody in her town wanted to stop her but she didn't give up and she made her dreams come true, achieving her goal. In my opinion the story is very entertaining because in Judy's process to be a police officer there are a lot of people she meets and a lot of difficulties she pass through. In general, the movie is very good in its animated cinematography, also the soundtrack is really awesome and specially because there is one song that the famous singer Shakira sings. One of the best scenes in all the movie is when Judy and his partner Nick run away from a jaguar because it turns savage in a rainforest. Since Zootopia is an animated movie, the special effects are made according to the all the computer-made animation, but they're very well made because they cause impact to some children that make them like the movie, and the emotions in the movie are very impressive, especially for kids, because they are very good expressed and you feel like if they were real. My rating for this movie is of 9/10 stars, so I think it's an awesome movie and the people who watch it will be very appointed with it, also I recommend people to watch it because it's very creative and entertaining with all the scenographies and the characters presented in the movie, and finally, this movie shows you a good lesson: Don't give up if you have a goal you want to achieve, even if something or someone tries to stop you.

Firstly, Zootropolis (or Zootopia depending where you come from) is much, much more than your generic Disney film. It will actually entertain a higher age demographic rather than younger kids due to it's exciting story and mature themes and because it is more a crime drama than a comedy. Yes, the directors and writers aren't afraid to explore much more darker and mature themes then they usually do and they do throw in a few jump worthy parts. On the other hand, the kids will probably enjoy seeing the animals speak but adults will be really engaged because of it's story. This film definitely deserved it's Academy Award Oscar for 'Best Animated Feature'. Secondly, this film had me hooked all the way through because of its detective and mysterious themes and its crime drama story, it's frequently humourous sequences and because the film had a surprising amount of an emotional weight towards it. Even though the tone is normally dark for an animated Disney film, the film still allows for some hilarious moments that, luckily, doesn't affect the overall tone. And like all modern Disney films, this film has stunning backdrops and top-notch animation and the soundtrack isn't half bad, either, alongside side it's exciting score. Furthermore, Zootropolis works well because of it's extremely likeable characters, who have emotional and sympathetic backstories, it's story, which is well paced, extremely well told and presented, and as the chemistry between Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps is rich and compelling because of it's well written dialogue and great casting choices including Idris Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. Not only that but Zootropolis thrills in it's tension filled action sequences and due to it's shocking plot twists; Zootropolis also allows Godfather fans to be delighted as well. In the end, Zootropolis isn't your average animated film because it is much more than that, it has an extremely intriguing, unprecedented presence and a well told story and is aided by compelling characters and fun moments. Zootropolis not only sets a bar high for future animated films but is probably one the best animated films ever made as of 2016. Additionally, Zootropolis is also one of the most enjoyable family films ever made.

5.0,2018-04-11,"Zootropolis (Zootopia) was a part of my highly anticipated list of movies for this year. Sure, Deadpool looked amazing (and was, according to nearly everyone) and Batman V Superman was the NEXT BIG THING but there was just something about Zootropolis that made me so excited. After reviews started rolling in, it got me even more excited, Chris Stuckmann's review especially. (Link at the bottom of review) And now I finally got to watch it. And I can simply say that Zootropolis was...AMAZING! Oh by the way, this review is SPOILER FREE. The Story Zootropolis's story is about a passionate little bunny known as Judy Hopps. She wants to do good for the world and decides that she wants to be a cop. This isn't very common and many of the other animals show that but Judy thinks that everyone can be whoever they want to be. When she has her first case, she isn't given much so she teams up with a fox known as Nick Wilde to help her solve the case. I really like this story as Nick and Judy get to learn more about each other throughout the story and as well as that, it results in a really fun, family adventure. The Characters Oh my the characters. In my opinion, this is Zootropolis's strongest parts. They are just so likeable! And before I talk about them, I have to talk about how well the actors portray them. I think Ginnifer Goodwin did a brilliant job at voicing Judy and I haven't seen many movies with Jason Bateman as a voice of a character or a character but I think he did an excellent job as Nick. And I can't forget Idris Elba's performance as Chief Bogo (the one who gives out the cases) He nailed it. Alright, now what I thought about them. Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde steal the show completely. (well, they are the main characters)They both have strengths and weaknesses which show throughout the movie a lot and they do have some really funny, touching and quite crazy moments that I will not spoil. And even though Chief Bogo is that character who can be a bit of a jerk at the beginning, you come to see him from a different perspective when the movie goes on. There are many more characters that do a really good job but this section is already too big. On to the animation. The Animation As usual, Disney did a great job with the animation. The action scenes look great, the visuals are fantastic and the city itself is huge. I may now sound like i'm doing a video game review but i'm not. The city is beautiful with flying colors. (quite literally actually) So yeah, they did a really good job, as usual. The Comedy If you watch Chris Stuckmann's Review, he says that: ""It is more focused on it's story then making you laugh. And that's something I loved about it."" And I agree. I think the story is brilliant and because of it, when the jokes come up, there actually hilarious. The comedy is focused around children and adults so of course, there will be jokes where only the adults will laugh or only the children. According to other reviewers, the scene with ""Mr Big"" was paying homage to: ""The Godfather."" And even though I haven't seen The Godfather, the whole scene was really funny. This goes to show you what you're going to expect. And here's the final part of the review... The Serious Note/ The Message Now is when I talk to you about the serious note. This movie focuses on so many different subjects you don't think a Disney movie would ever cover. I actually quite like it because it adds a little more originality to it. If you have ever watched Happy Feet, it was trying to deliver a message. But the way they did was so childlike that it made it pointless for older kids or adults. But Zootopia did it with a more serious tone and a non forceful way that it really delivered it well. The Grade I love Zootropolis. It's message is brought well, it's animation is great, it's characters are awesome, it's comedy is hilarious, it's story is brilliant and it's serious tone makes it even better. This movie is defiantly 100% worth watching and i'm going to give it an A+ Chris Stuckmann's Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du7wcFPBfIE",742,en,zootropolis zootopia part highly anticipated list movie year sure deadpool looked amazing according nearly everyone batman v superman next big thing something zootropolis made excited review started rolling got even excited chris stuckmann review especially link bottom review finally got watch simply say zootropolis amazing oh way review spoiler free story zootropolis story passionate little bunny known judy hopps want good world decides want cop common many animal show judy think everyone whoever want first case given much team fox known nick wilde help solve case really like story nick judy get learn throughout story well result really fun family adventure character oh character opinion zootropolis strongest part likeable talk talk well actor portray think ginnifer goodwin brilliant job voicing judy seen many movie jason bateman voice character character think excellent job nick forget idris elba performance chief bogo one give case nailed alright thought judy hopps nick wilde steal show completely well main character strength weakness show throughout movie lot really funny touching quite crazy moment spoil even though chief bogo character bit jerk beginning come see different perspective movie go many character really good job section already big animation animation usual disney great job animation action scene look great visuals fantastic city huge may sound like video game review city beautiful flying color quite literally actually yeah really good job usual comedy watch chris stuckmann review say focused story making laugh something loved agree think story brilliant joke come actually hilarious comedy focused around child adult course joke adult laugh child according reviewer scene mr big paying homage godfather even though seen godfather whole scene really funny go show going expect final part review serious note message talk serious note movie focus many different subject think disney movie would ever cover actually quite like add little originality ever watched happy foot trying deliver message way childlike made pointless older kid adult zootopia serious tone non forceful way really delivered well grade love zootropolis message brought well animation great character awesome comedy hilarious story brilliant serious tone make even better movie defiantly worth watching going give chris stuckmann review http www youtube com watch v du wcfpbfie,2018-04,358,3.7125203171459886

4.5,2018-03-16,"Zootopia is the 30th highest grossing film of all time, and the fourth animated film to pass $1 billion in global box-office earnings. Judy Hopps, the determined and enthusiastic main character, decides she wants better for herself, even when something else is expected. She faces many hardships as she realizes that creating a different reality for herself will be a lot harder than she first believed. Her difficulties point to the fact that she is a female, and a smaller prey species. In the end, Judy is successful in creating the change that she had been wanting for so long. Zootopia was created to teach people of all ages that goals and dreams can be reached through hard work and determination, no matter what circumstances they may be in. The directors were successful in getting the point across. This essay will analyze the use of irony, symbolism, and a great storyline to show evidence of the creators purpose throughout the film. The directors of Zootopia waste no time in presenting situational irony in the beginning. The main characters are introduced, and we meet Judy Hopps. She is a small bunny with a very large family, and two carrot farmers for parents. She is literally at the ""bottom of the food chain"" in her society. The ironic part of the situation is that she wants to become a police officer. In her world, this workforce is comprised only of large male animals. The creators do this to immediately place her in a position where she is at a disadvantage. To the viewers, her wish to become a cop is almost comical, and the task seems impossible because of her situation. In the end, however, Judy does become a police officer. She not only becomes a cop, she ends up being one of the most successful ones who solves a huge mystery case. The overall story is a testament that if Judy can turn her life around, anyone can. Symbolism is also included in the movie, and it is one of the most powerful tools used in the film to convey the creator's purpose. The characters present in the movie represent many different types of people in the real world. The wide variety of animal species shown in the film are meant to represent the different races, social classes, intelligence levels, etc.., that are present in today's world. The directors do this to give viewers the ability to connect with certain characters that they might be similar to in reality. This is meant to empower the minds of young viewers as they watch the actions of the characters that they connect with. They see them working hard to set goals, and successfully achieve them. This leaves people with a healthy mindset and a hope that they can always better themselves, no matter the circumstances. The overall story itself is another way the point is made. Judy's life and work are anything but easy, and she is constantly dealing with new challenges. She stays optimistic and hopeful for most of the movie, but there is one instance where she finds herself wanting to give up because of the hardships she is facing. These details are crucial to the development of the main idea because it shows viewers how to deal with problems in a healthy way, while maintaining a good attitude. On the other hand, it also shows that the road will be tough, and there will be times where quitting will sound like the best option. Judy does not give up though, and we see her push forward and succeed in the end. Some people think that Zootopia is simply just a kid movie made to do nothing but entertain young children. While the story is animated and easy enough for kids to understand, it has way too many good messages in it to be considered just a kids movie. It teaches things in a way that people of all ages can understand, but the messages taught are very beneficial for people to learn at a young age and carry with them for the rest of their lives. Zootopia is a great film that everyone must see at some point in life. The lessons of hard work and determination are presented through a variety of tools that definitely get the point across to the viewers of the movie. It does this while also remaining exciting and entertaining for young children to enjoy. Judy Hopps is placed in a tough situation, but leaves it successful and strong. Her journey captivates the hearts and minds of many and gives the opportunity for viewers to be inspired by her success and character. The directors want everyone to know that it doesn't matter if a journey has a less than great start. The only thing that matters is that the goal is reached and that there was something learned from the process of getting there.",819,en,zootopia th highest grossing film time fourth animated film pas billion global box office earnings judy hopps determined enthusiastic main character decides want better even something else expected face many hardship realizes creating different reality lot harder first believed difficulty point fact female smaller prey specie end judy successful creating change wanting long zootopia created teach people age goal dream reached hard work determination matter circumstance may director successful getting point across essay analyze use irony symbolism great storyline show evidence creator purpose throughout film director zootopia waste time presenting situational irony beginning main character introduced meet judy hopps small bunny large family two carrot farmer parent literally bottom food chain society ironic part situation want become police officer world workforce comprised large male animal creator immediately place position disadvantage viewer wish become cop almost comical task seems impossible situation end however judy become police officer becomes cop end one successful one solves huge mystery case overall story testament judy turn life around anyone symbolism also included movie one powerful tool used film convey creator purpose character present movie represent many different type people real world wide variety animal specie shown film meant represent different race social class intelligence level etc present today world director give viewer ability connect certain character might similar reality meant empower mind young viewer watch action character connect see working hard set goal successfully achieve leaf people healthy mindset hope always better matter circumstance overall story another way point made judy life work anything easy constantly dealing new challenge stay optimistic hopeful movie one instance find wanting give hardship facing detail crucial development main idea show viewer deal problem healthy way maintaining good attitude hand also show road tough time quitting sound like best option judy give though see push forward succeed end people think zootopia simply kid movie made nothing entertain young child story animated easy enough kid understand way many good message considered kid movie teach thing way people age understand message taught beneficial people learn young age carry rest life zootopia great film everyone must see point life lesson hard work determination presented variety tool definitely get point across viewer movie also remaining exciting entertaining young child enjoy judy hopps placed tough situation leaf successful strong journey captivates heart mind many give opportunity viewer inspired success character director want everyone know matter journey less great start thing matter goal reached something learned process getting,2018-03,402,3.2130383860046186

4.0,2018-01-01,"I'm actually a bit surprised Disney took a stab at a movie with this kind of weight. Maybe it's because I watched Hidden Figures yesterday or that headlines each day remind me of the great dichotomy of ""us vs. them..."" Zootopia is a movie about race, and I don't expect it to be the last one I watch in this year's Academy lineup. Rather than addressing race on, Zootopia is wise in the way many newer Disney movies have made commentary through analogy. ""Predators versus prey"" is something we teach all children, but framing race as Zootopia does allows parents to have a much-needed discussion with the next generation of global citizens. It's especially poignant that in this classic crime story, the case - and the racial inequality - is solved by small-town residents unaware that their own actions have a meaningful impact on the equality of the world. Like I said, hats off to Disney. As a nominee for the Best Animated category, it's still too early to say if Zootopia has the chops to take out its Disney sibling Moana or the other movies on the list. There are some stunning examples of animation, especially with falling rain, waterfalls, and other liquids - that's one area of animation I often forget is animated. It's hard not to fall in love with each character in Zootopia, and the animation does everything to support (and nothing to detract) from that process as a member of the audience. Though it seems like a bit of a sleeper among their animated lineup (especially with the early March 2016 release it had), I'm excited that Zootopia will get seen by a few more children - and a few more adults - as a result of its nomination. Zootopia will probably end up on my shelf when I have kids, if only for how well it handles race relations. I'm still wondering whether I'm 'predator' or 'prey,' and if I even want to be.",330,en,actually bit surprised disney took stab movie kind weight maybe watched hidden figure yesterday headline day remind great dichotomy u v zootopia movie race expect last one watch year academy lineup rather addressing race zootopia wise way many newer disney movie made commentary analogy predator versus prey something teach child framing race zootopia allows parent much needed discussion next generation global citizen especially poignant classic crime story case racial inequality solved small town resident unaware action meaningful impact equality world like said hat disney nominee best animated category still early say zootopia chop take disney sibling moana movie list stunning example animation especially falling rain waterfall liquid one area animation often forget animated hard fall love character zootopia animation everything support nothing detract process member audience though seems like bit sleeper among animated lineup especially early march release excited zootopia get seen child adult result nomination zootopia probably end shelf kid well handle race relation still wondering whether predator prey even want,2018-01,162,3.4739653538684316

The supervisions were Rich Moore who is known as supervision of ""The Simpson's"" and ""Sugar Rush"" and Byron Howard, who is known as a supervision of ""Mulan"" and ""Tangled"". This movie were so famous and won 41 awards all over the world. This movie tells us three important things. First, to keep dreaming is important to realize our dream. The main character of rabbit Judy had had a dream since she was a child but her parents thought her dream cannot come true. However, she kept tying everything to realize her dream so hardly. We will be changed our mind by her action in this movie. Second, we should live together without discrimination. There were two kind of animals carnivores and herbivores in this movie. We think herbivorous were weaker than carnivores but this thought made a dangerous problem in this story. Finally, to deceive is bad. The character of fox Nick deceived many animals with his partner of fennec fox Finnick. However, their minds had changed since they met Judy. I personally think our world and thought will change brighter and positive after we watch this movie. The main character of rabbit Judy had dream to be a police in Zootopia. Zootopia is one utopia which carnivores and herbivores can live together. However, her parents did not think her dream comes true because she is a rabbit. Actually all the police had been carnivores before she became to a police in Zootopia. However, she did not give up and try to everything. Her effort bore fruit and became a police in Zootopia. However, there were discriminations between carnivores and herbivores in her workplace. Subsequently, she found Nick deceived animals for getting much money when she was going on patrol in Zootopia. He promised to help her work in order to get released. Their combination solved many problems in Zootopia and animals' thought of carnivores and herbivores relationship was changed by their working. We can learn three important things to live in our earth from this story. First, to keep dreaming, second, we should live together without discrimination and lastly, to deceive is bad. This movie gives good effect not only adults, but also children. Therefore, I recommend watching this movie with family. I especially like Judy and Nick's combination. Judy is a herbivore and Nick is a carnivore, so they were different kinds from animal, but they made good relationship each other little by little.

2.5,2017-09-20,"I didn't know what to think about this movie before I saw it. There was so much hype I was afraid to be disappointed. All I knew was that it was highly anticipated, and when it came out people went crazy for it. Critics and audiences alike loved this movie for being ""real,"" and coming out at ""just the right time in America."" This was mainly due to the fact that film talks a lot about race, while not talking directly about race. You see, it's like Paddington, Babar, or Curious George in that way. It talks about race, but only through animals. So it's not actually portraying people of color, but using anthropomorphic creatures to do so. The movie would have been so much more effective if they animated people of color and the institutions which keep white people privileged. But they don't. Instead it's incredibly confusing when it comes to who are the haves, and who are the have nots. They may have done this to be ambiguous in order to show that many people are intersectional, but because they're animals, it doesn't really work that way. Like do black sheep have different standards and societal expectations than white sheep? The animal allegory doesn't work unless they're all the same animal because it literally shows us that races are different species (eugenics), when that isn't true. Lastly, you can map out the plot from a mile away. So let's dive into the good, the bad and the ugly, with Zootopia. Very simply put, the movie is about a rabbit and a fox. The rabbit, named Judy, wants to be a cop. But because she's a prey animal and also a woman - they don't really address gender that much, but for the sake of this review, I will - she's not supposed to be a cop, she's supposed to remain a little farm bunny. But like most Disney female characters she wants more than ""this provincial life,"" so she moves to Zootopia, a utopian city where prey and predator live together in harmony. This of course isn't true as Judy soon finds out. She faces prejudice as a prey animal at work and in the city, but decides to take her destiny in her own paws. She tackles a huge who done it mystery case and teams up with a criminal fox, Nick, and the unlikely duo solves the crime. The villain (spoilers) turns out to be a white sheep, a seemingly innocent prey animal. All in all, the moral is, looks can be deceiving, and anyone can be whatever they want to be, no matter what society says. I love the land of Zootopia. I think it's so creative how they make a Sahara part, a jungle part, a tundra part, and even a tiny rodent village. That's awesome! But aside from a few scenes, they don't really show much of the city. I also don't like how the animal allegory has so many plot holes. And this is mainly because the movie uses animals instead of people! Lastly, Shakira and Judy are constantly sexualized. The villain is obvious and the movie is long. Sitting through the misunderstanding between Nick and Judy was agonizing. So, the racial allegory, does it do its job? No. I was constantly confused in the movie if they were trying to confirm that reverse racism exists. Sometimes it seemed as though the prey were the people of color and the predators were white. This happens when Nick tries touching the sheep's hair and Judy says, ""You know you can't just touch a sheep's wool."" This is obviously mimicking real life, when you can't just go up and touch a black person's hair. Sometimes it makes it seem as though it's the other way around, and the prey are white and the people of color are predators. What the f*ck? This can be seen when the prey animals are trying to ""civilize"" the predators. The predators are thugs and ""black."" This can be seen with the jaguar who goes ""savage"" because savagery is a trait put on African Americans as well as indigenous people. So does that mean the prey is white and the people of color are predators? Maybe they're saying that the white people (prey) are actually the savages and taking a Pocahontas/Paddington route? I just don't know. And that's a problem because if the movie is going for a racial allegory, then it has to be clear. But instead it's muddled because Disney was too afraid to use people, so they used cute little animals to tell their ""progressive"" story. I also didn't like the comedic elements in the film. There was the nudist thing. Was that supposed to be funny? Animals not wearing clothes, ha-ha? Then The Godfather references were meh. It's been done before. Then of course you have the Disney/Pixar trope of juxtaposing an animal's size with the type of voice it has. In Zootopia, there's a small animal with a deep voice. It's similar to Up with the evil dog having a high pitched voice, or the cute baby form The Incredibles who is actually the devil. I'm TIRED OF IT. The other problematic part I have with the film is the sexualization of animals. I know they're supposed to be anthropomorphic and take on human qualities. But really, we're going give a bunny boobs and hips? We're going to sexualize Giselle -Shakira's character - by having the camera hold on her animal butt uncomfortably? These are animals! They're not sexy. Well, maybe they are to some people, but it's also adding to the sexualization of female characters. The men are not sexualized the same way the women are. In fact, the men are able to have a wide range of body types, while the females are given very little. But as for the main characters, Judy's body is much more ""feminine"" than Nick's. Nick just looks like a fox on his hind legs, but Judy is given curves, why, if not to titillate the presumably straight men watching it. I guess if I had to say something I liked about the film, it would have to be my favorite scene. I love the part where Judy is spying on Nick and discovers his undercover Popsicle scheme. It's really cool seeing different parts of the city, how his life works, and the different animals he meets. Nick, unlike Judy, rolls with his stereotype as the ""sly fox."" But this brings me to another problem, some animals fit into their stereotypes while others don't. Why is this? To create a wide range of characters, or for comedic effect? Ha-ha that animal doesn't fit into our expectations; therefore it's funny because they're different. I think the best example of this is the overweight cheetah who works the front desk at the Zootopia police department. He's a stereotypical fat, donut eating cop. But he's also fat, and a cheetah. Does that give his character depth? No, they just use him as a pawn to make some jokes with. There is a point where he has to move to the back of the office because predators are now scary, I don't know if he's supposed to be black or white here... he could be black because a lot of people in the human world discriminate against black people because they're not as universal as white people are. They're also seen as meaner and ruder. Therefore, why would you want one welcoming you at the front desk? Or could it be he's losing his white privilege? The movie doesn't make that very clear. So some animals fit into a stereotype, others don't (Judy). That fits in with the message that looks are deceiving, but sometimes looks are also true? Like cops eat donuts? The DMV are sloths? Also, in the end Nick and Judy get together, is that an allegory for an in interracial couple? Why didn't they just use real people? It would have been so much more effective. Also, if it is supposed to be a race allegory, can we tell what races/ethnicities the actors are by their voices? In my opinion, that's a common way people can make things seem ""diverse."" Of course it's impossible to know what race a person is by their voice, but it is used on the radio all the time to make their shows seem ""diverse."" Do you think it was used here? I knew the two leads were voiced by white people, I knew the Indian elephant was voiced by someone of Indian descent, and I knew that Mrs. Otterton was voiced by a black woman. I didn't know Chief Bogo was voiced by a black man however. This clearly shows that you can't tell what race people are by their voice, but that is the intention of some media, especially when the character is just a voice. And I think voice acting in animated shows use this trick too, in order to prove they have a diverse cast they may want to hire people with more of an 'accent' than others. And because of this, I was socialized to associate the hyenas from The Lion King, with black people. Thanks Disney. Overall, I just don't get it. I don't think the movie is ground breaking or diverse in anyway. I don't think the morals are very strong seeing that they're using animals to tell a human story. Wouldn't it have been stronger to tell it with real kids? Reflect real life with real people? Even CGI people would have been better than this.

Finally, the moral of this story is try everything even it hard to get the job. that message is very good. Let talk about Judy. Judy the rabbit was the excellent example because she believe herself and want to be the first rabbit to be the police officer at the Zootopia. even her parent thought it's too dangerous and challenge can be very difficult, she never give up her dream, past all challenge, and become the police officer.

4.5,2017-08-16,"Disney presents here an all-round impressive film, colourful and bright for a junior audience and remarkably thoughtful and profound for its older viewers. Visually stunning, the film is accentuated by a talented vocal cast, led by Ginnifer Goodwin who is simply perfect as bunny cop, Judy Hopps and Jason Bateman, with a very Fantastic Mr Fox-esque performance as Nick Wilde. The film's tone verges on some of the most threatening that we have ever seen from Disney, with sociological undertones that, despite being slightly glossed over, unfortunately, still are remarkably noticeable in the narrative. As a whole, the film is wonderfully creative and the world of Zootopia is both imaginatively thought out and stunningly executed. The plot is typical self-discovery, but Zootopia is a mystery flick, at heart. The plot is good, but you cannot help feeling the filmmakers had more potential to explore the world they had created and were holding back a little for what could have made the film more interesting. This is real nitpicking though; for the most part, Zootopia is one of the best Disney films ever made, certainly the best of the modern Renaissance.

5.0,2017-08-10,"""Disney: Hilariously Exploiting Stereotypes In Animal Form"" Who would have thought that another Disney animation focused on the lives of animals would be such a hit? If you want to laugh, cry, be uplifted, and experience a myriad of emotions, then Zootopia is the movie for you. Kids will love the cute animals depicted throughout the movie, as well as childish humor that kids will giggle hysterically at. Moreover, adults will not struggle with keeping their attention focused on the movie, like most ""Kid"" movies, because of the amazing artistry and captivating plot. An astounding feat that the film accomplished is the teaching opportunity it took to discuss, for all ages, real world issues that we struggle with around the world today. From the tiny stature of a mob boss arctic shrew, Mr. Big, to the largest elephant yoga teacher, the metropolis of Zootopia is a place thought to be where all types of animals can live, thrive, and make their dreams come true. This is the case for a small town bunny name Judy Hopps (wonderfully voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin). Judy a determined and peppy rabbit with the inability to stop pursuing her dreams becomes the first bunny police officer in Zootopia. With the odds stacked against her, Officer Hopps takes on a curious case that will make or break her dreams and the metropolis of Zootopia. On her quest, Judy pairs up with an unimaginable partner, a con artist fox named Nick Wilde (brilliantly voiced by Jason Bateman). Together the unthinkable partners have to piece together clues to solve the mysterious case that could prove to be the end of the marvelous metropolis of Zootopia. The amazing plot of the movie takes on the difficult task to teach its viewers the complexities and blatant issues of the world that may or may not be easily noticed. For example, two true enemies in the animal kingdom, a fox and bunny, have to set aside their differences to make sure that their metropolis survives. How is this any different in the real human world today? One can take many approaches to this issue such as Republicans and Democrats working together, high-income citizens cooperating and working with low-income citizens, black and white Americans working together, and many other real life scenarios that cause conflict in the world. This issue between Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps teaches us that we have a choice to who we are and we can put aside our differences and work together harmoniously. A particular point in the film that demonstrated the stroke of genius from the directors is the incorporation of the DMV run by sloths. It is common knowledge that sloths are some of the slowest moving creatures on earth, and the DMV is one of the most frustrating government agencies because of their slothful nature in dealing with customers. This hilarious and outrageous portrayal in which officer Hopps has to struggle with a sluggish sloth when she is in a hurry to get pertinent information dealing with her case gives a classic representation of real world frustration that many have undergone. The simple yet complex features throughout the movie provide a stimulating and relatable story. As the movie progresses, an underlying issue is finally revealed that will shock the audience. The issue brought to light is that sometimes the real threat to an individual or society is not the predator in the relationship, but the conniving prey. The movie teaches us that we need to put our prejudices aside so we can make correct decisions based on actual evidence, rather than viewing things through biased lenses. This is a powerful message that is placed in the movie that demonstrates the calamity in the world, especially in the United States, because of previous historical issues that will not be put to rest. Directors Bryon Howard, Richard Moore, and Jared Bush put their minds together to create a unique reality in which animals endure the same small and large concerns that humans do. Some of which include dirty politics, racism, and the struggle to live harmoniously with people of all backgrounds. This fascinating parallel between skin color and animal variety shares a beautiful angle on the diversity of the world. With their creative perspective, the directors flawlessly incorporated other iconic films into Zootopia such as ""The Godfather"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", and many other classic films. This tasteful placement of themes of iconic films adds a subtle complexity that made the movie enjoyable to all age ranges. Walt Disney productions over the past few years have been impeccable, including Big Hero Six, Tangled, and the widely popular Frozen. Individuals that have seen these films understand the amazing results that all these movies have achieved, but many would conclude that they have reached the peak of their performance. These conclusions couldn't be more wrong because Zootopia is Disney's true masterpiece.

4.0,2017-07-05,"I can think of no other film that is as timely as this one. Though it's a typical Disney film in structure, the entire film is an overt allegory for racism... and how we each can do our part to overcome prejudice and adversity in society. The protagonist is little Judy Hopps, who aspires to become a police officer despite her diminutive bunny stature and country-bumpkin background. Judy is a great protagonist and worthy role model for little girls, or anybody really. The weird thing about her, and what makes this movie so different, is that she's a racist. She doesn't want to be, and tries very hard not to be, and the story follows her as she begins to realize her prejudices and works to overcome them. The overall message of inclusion and celebrating diversity is a timely and important one, and one that has never been so fully expressed in a children's film. The movie touches on some pretty sensitive racial and gender stereotypes, including some not-so-disguised Islamophobia. I said to myself ""Damn, I can't believe they went there"" more than once. So yeah, it does get a little heavy for a Disney film, but there is enough humor and action mixed in to lighten up the subject matter. Though the movie is clever, the writing is not inherently all that funny... most of the credit for the film's humor is due to the excellent work by the voice actors. Their delivery is really spot on and made me laugh out loud, notably Jason Bateman and Idris Elba (who I am really loving as a voice actor!!). Then there is the cutting-edge animation, which is truly amazing... you can see every hair on each body. It's pretty eye-popping.

5.0,2017-06-23,"In 2016, a year when it was still thought that there was far more acceptance than hate, Zootopia brilliantly put together a piece of animation that shows an animal world not all that different from our own, complete with the social issues, granted between former predators and prey, as opposed to our problems of skin color and religion. The best way to see this world was through the hopeful eyes of Judy Hops, and her belief that she could change the world, and that Zootopia was this amazing, perfect place. Drop in a con artist sidekick, and you've got the levity to her unwavering perkiness. The message stays out there through the entire film, as Judy's hopefulness and country naivete are integral to the proper development of the story. It's all fine and well for a while, even despite a sarcastic back and forth relationship between Judy and the Fox, Nick, who eventually grows on her and the audience as we learn more about him, and as the experience of his adventure changes him. The movie zips by, has plenty of nuggets for the adults, and a number of fun moments to entertain the littlest of kids. We can see our reflections in this movie, and it hopes to show us that we're not all that different, and that we should have hope to get along. It's a fine thing, and something that our kids could hopefully learn, and maybe one day use as a way to change the world.

4.5,2017-04-10,"Zootopia (2016) - Has made a huge impact on a lot of people and at first I never understood why. I never thought the movie was going to be bad but I just didn't think that this would be the next big thing for Disney especially after their amazing lineup of films like ""Tangled"" and ""Big Hero 6"". However, when I finally saw the movie I was completely blown away and now I see why everyone loves this film so much. There were two things that stood out to me, one of them was the chemistry between Judy and Nick. They are probably one of the most irresistible Disney pairings since Rapunzel and Flynn Rider. I really loved the way they work off of each other as well as warming up to share their feelings. The other thing I loved is the way they establish the city of Zootopia itself. Through a clever use of imagery we see how Predators and Prey became what they are today. We also see the many districts that Zootopia has to offer and they take full advantage of showing of each and every one of them and how unique they are. The other part of the story includes a mystery that our heroes have to crack. The mystery only keeps getting bigger and bigger as the movie plays on and the places they visit all have a critical importance into bringing our characters closer to the final reveal. The side characters they meet along the way all have their memorable moments and some of them play important roles into cracking the case. The big thing that caught many people's attention was the morals of Racism and discrimination against others. It does go pretty deep when telling those messages and hits a homerun for a lot of people. I think the way they use Predator and Prey to teach that moral is genius and leads to a lot of heartfelt moments that did make me feel emotional from time to time. The animation is mind blowing and they capture the feeling of being in a big city while also adding features like size and scope to make Zootopia feel so universal to any size of mammal. The characters also look very Disney and it's very cool how each one of them is accurately sized like their real life counterparts. The music was done by Michael Giacchino. You may recognize him as the composer for many Pixar films like ""Ratatouille"" and ""Inside out"". The music features a lot of electric guitar beats and bass strums which really help embrace the feeling of big city life. Theres also a featured pop song by Shakira called ""Try Everything"" and it plays itself out as an inspirational song that really does fit the movie's theme and everything it stands for. My only nitpick would have to be the pace of the third act. It doesn't ruin anything and it's done great in terms of the story, but I felt like after coming off everything that happened in the 2nd act, it just felt a little off when things start to come back to together. Overall, I was surprised by this movie and it's probably one of the best that Disney has to offer.

5.0,2017-03-24,"Zootopia is an excellent Disney movie. So excellent that I am so tempted to watch it a 2nd time. And surprisingly, due to its very complex and adult-themed narrative, younger children might be actually bored with it (the young children at my showing was pretty restless!!) It is directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore (both respectively directed Tangled and Wreck-It-Ralph; both are excellent Disney movies in their own right!). It stars Ginnifer Goodwin as the voice of an optimistic,energetic,lovable female bunny, Judy Hopps; and Jason Bateman as a street-smart fox named Nick Wilde. It is a buddy-cop/thriller dramedy; which is very unusual and groundbreaking for a Disney movie! It has excellent graphics and cinematography; with bright colour palettes. The movie's setting is in a world where humans never existed; and the animals evolved so much that they are now living as humans with modern tech, wearing clothes, and both predator and prey species live in harmony (supposedly). Judy is a cop bunny; the first of its kind. Looked down by other cops due to her species & gender, she became embroiled in a missing persons mystery in which a dozen mammals have gone missing without a trace. In her journey to find the culprit/villain; she seeks the help of Nick, a con-fox. Some of the animals still exhibit some animal habits; with Judy twitching his nose when in fear, which is clever aspect and interesting. This movie's plot touches on the central theme of empowerment, gender discrimination,racism,drug, friendship, and self-worth. Zootopia manage to expertly balance comedy with drama. There are many laugh-out moments in this movie which keep me in stitches; especially the Godfather & giant monster parodies; and any scenes involving slothes. Yet the plot is also mysterious (whodunit), with satisfying twists and horrifying scenes; and with a satisfying villain-reveal and finale. There was a never dull moment in this movie.

4.5,2017-03-03,"Zootopia: Bunny Cop to the Rescue Zootopia: Disney's best animated movie of 2016 is full of cheerful, courageous, and slightly disapproving characters who take you on a remarkable journey to save their beloved city, Zootopia. Early in the movie when Judy is seeing Zootopia for the first time you get an impression of what Zootopia really is. A city where racism does not exist and where diversity is accepted. Zootopia is the place where both predators and prey have evolved past their natural desire to kill each other and live in grace. Its charm results from the spectacular animation and witty script. Judy Hopps (perfectly voiced by Gennifer Goodwin) is a bunny who has her mind set on becoming the first female cop and move to the big city of Zootopia where she presumes to be just like the big city cops. Judy, who lives in a farm with her 275 brothers and sisters, gets no support from her parents who want her to stay and help build their business, but Judy, listening to her heart, follows her dreams. She goes through strenuous training and her hard work pays off because she finishes top of her class and she quickly decides to put her skills to good use and moves to the big city of Zootopia. She is immediately struck with the brutal truth of adult life where she has a depressing apartment. Judy reports to work and quickly becomes frustrated. No one takes her seriously because she is a tiny bunny. On her very first day she is assigned traffic duty. Her boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba) clearly has no faith in her and even shows signs of regrets when it came to hiring a female bunny. However that doesn't stop Judy Hopps. This film demonstrates that even when the world wants you to fail, if you believe in yourself you can achieve anything. This is why Zootopia is one of the best Disney movies ever made. When Judy is finally presented with a real case she has to uncover the truth behind the mysterious disappearance of mammals all over the city. She only has one clue though, a cunning fox named Nick (voice of Jason Bateman). The two set out on a wild, bizarre, dangerous mission to find out what is happening to the mammals of Zootopia. The film nailed the chemistry between Judy and Nick specifically when they find themselves in danger when they search for a paranoid and ominous panther named Mr. Manchas (voice by Jesse Corti). You just know that even when the movie takes some dark turns, nothing will separate the two. Zootopia demonstrates the values of true friendship and what teamwork can accomplish, as well as displaying what courage, faith, and commitment accomplish if you never give up. Furthermore, there is no targeted audience with this film because anyone at any age could benefit from watching a movie like this. The length of the movie is long enough to include all the details necessary and not leave people baffled because of unanswered questions. Another strong aspect of the film was the incredibly talented animation which included a touch of realism throughout the whole film and it did not go unnoticed since it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. It's very much demonstrated with the features of the city and with the many different animal species, particularly when Judy was saying goodbye to her family and we get a glimpse of all of her siblings. Zootopia may not have the single alongs that Frozen has, but it's clever enough to catch your attention when personal resilience is so well demonstrated and captures your emotions so well. It conveys a message that are rarely seen in movies for children:Success is no accident. It's hard work, studying, learning, sacrifice and love for what you are doing.",642,en,zootopia bunny cop rescue zootopia disney best animated movie full cheerful courageous slightly disapproving character take remarkable journey save beloved city zootopia early movie judy seeing zootopia first time get impression zootopia really city racism exist diversity accepted zootopia place predator prey evolved past natural desire kill live grace charm result spectacular animation witty script judy hopps perfectly voiced gennifer goodwin bunny mind set becoming first female cop move big city zootopia presumes like big city cop judy life farm brother sister get support parent want stay help build business judy listening heart follows dream go strenuous training hard work pay finish top class quickly decides put skill good use move big city zootopia immediately struck brutal truth adult life depressing apartment judy report work quickly becomes frustrated one take seriously tiny bunny first day assigned traffic duty bos chief bogo idris elba clearly faith even show sign regret came hiring female bunny however stop judy hopps film demonstrates even world want fail believe achieve anything zootopia one best disney movie ever made judy finally presented real case uncover truth behind mysterious disappearance mammal city one clue though cunning fox named nick voice jason bateman two set wild bizarre dangerous mission find happening mammal zootopia film nailed chemistry judy nick specifically find danger search paranoid ominous panther named mr manchas voice jesse corti know even movie take dark turn nothing separate two zootopia demonstrates value true friendship teamwork accomplish well displaying courage faith commitment accomplish never give furthermore targeted audience film anyone age could benefit watching movie like length movie long enough include detail necessary leave people baffled unanswered question another strong aspect film incredibly talented animation included touch realism throughout whole film go unnoticed since academy award best animated feature much demonstrated feature city many different animal specie particularly judy saying goodbye family get glimpse sibling zootopia may single alongs frozen clever enough catch attention personal resilience well demonstrated capture emotion well conveys message rarely seen movie child success accident hard work studying learning sacrifice love,2017-03,337,3.207953934559459

Actually it is kind of two stories. One is the story of Judy Hopps fighting to prove herself as a police officer and the other is the more sinister evil plot that she attempts to unravel. The movie moves at a good enough speed leaving enough room to both tell the story itself and inserting jokes and comical situations. The two bureaucratic sloths were quite fun already in their first scenes but the last scene with them at the very end of the movie was absolutely hilarious.

3.0,2017-02-10,"Jason Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin lend their voices in Disney's Zootopia. Zootopia is an area where all animals are able to live together in harmony. Goodwin is Judy Hoops, a young rabbit that has aspirations to be a cop. She is of course ridiculed as rabbits are typical farmers that are not aggressive. She aims high and graduates from school only to become stereotyped again by her Water buffalo boss (Idris Elba) who makes her become a meter maid. To demonstrate that she can offer more to the force, she takes on a missing otter case and agrees to solve the case within 48 hours or quit. With few leads and evidence, she has no choice but to have a cunning fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) help her even though foxes are known for being mischievous and untrustworthy. As she investigates the case, she finds there is a strange occurrence where historical predators are becoming savage again. The She adds this mystery to the case and hopes to return Zootopia and make it safe for all animals again. Zootopia is above average animated film. The film offers enough humor for adults and the animation will likely dazzle young audiences alike. Many jokes rely on animals being stereotyped such as sloths for being slow and foxes being cunning. Bateman does a good job providing his sense of humor that will be appreciated by fans of his. Puns such as we need to address the elephant in the room, and there being a literal elephant in the room are also scattered throughout the film. Various films such as the Godfather are also parodied. The film does not have as clever or an original premise such as some of the other Pixar films. The concept of a bunch of different animals together seemed all too similar to the many Madagascar films made. As with many Disney films there is an overall good message to leave with the audience, and this one is to always believe in yourself and dreams, and to not judge a book (or an animal) by its cover. The film is well animated, but does not dazzle or leave one in awe. Although there is nothing particularly wrong or glaring with Zootopia, in the sea of animated films that are becoming more and more popular, Disney's Zootopia does not stand out as much as I had hoped. The film is a general crowd pleaser that does not take much risk and simply tries to entertain and that's not always a bad thing. -2.9.2017",423,en,jason bateman ginnifer goodwin lend voice disney zootopia zootopia area animal able live together harmony goodwin judy hoop young rabbit aspiration cop course ridiculed rabbit typical farmer aggressive aim high graduate school become stereotyped water buffalo bos idris elba make become meter maid demonstrate offer force take missing otter case agrees solve case within hour quit lead evidence choice cunning fox nick wilde jason bateman help even though fox known mischievous untrustworthy investigates case find strange occurrence historical predator becoming savage add mystery case hope return zootopia make safe animal zootopia average animated film film offer enough humor adult animation likely dazzle young audience alike many joke rely animal stereotyped sloth slow fox cunning bateman good job providing sense humor appreciated fan pun need address elephant room literal elephant room also scattered throughout film various film godfather also parodied film clever original premise pixar film concept bunch different animal together seemed similar many madagascar film made many disney film overall good message leave audience one always believe dream judge book animal cover film well animated dazzle leave one awe although nothing particularly wrong glaring zootopia sea animated film becoming popular disney zootopia stand much hoped film general crowd pleaser take much risk simply try entertain always bad thing,2017-02,208,3.1916640807261105

It looks excellent, but in this day and age and with the kind of talent and computing power Disney possesses, there's absolutely no excuse for their films to look poor. I did enjoy it for the most part, but there was the unescapable feeling that I'd seen it before, it's very brave for the issues of stereotyping and prejudice that it addresses, and proves that a company making film predominantly for children isn't afraid to also tackle adult issues.

The prey is in the majority, but the predators are in charge of (most of) the police and government. Both the prey and predators suffer from prejudice of different types, and then it gets more complicated when you break the prey and predator groups into types of animals and the stereotypes about them. So I don't know if the analogy crosses over into the human world perfectly. However, overall I think the message is good. Don't let stereotypes define you, and don't judge people based on them.

Zootopia is going to smash the holiday box office open as it is intelligent and fun the whole way through. The big thing to consider for this movie is whether it is suitable for young children. I had already read some reviews that were saying 5 and 6 years olds may find some scenes scary. And that could be true. I didn't think the boo scenes were that startling, there is really only one jump moment in the whole thing that made everyone leap out of their seats. The part I found most intense was the language. It is not swearing but the characters are rather forceful with their words. If you are uncomfortable with characters aggressively scratching or pushing each other while they say things like ""you jerk, shut up"", then this movie may be too old for your child. The one thing I can say without reserve is that all adults should go see it.

4.5,2016-12-15,"To begin with, my opinion on Disney's Zootopia is that it is a nicely animated and a fun to watch movie. Zootopia is based in a big city called Zootopia. Zootopia is full of a lot of different species who live all together in harmony. The characters in Zootopia are very likeable, fun, and entertaining in my opinion. The story is about a bunny named Judy Hopps which is voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin. Judy Hopps wants to be a cop so she graduates from a police academy to fulfil that dream. The rabbit, Judy, is the first of her species to become a cop so she is assigned to an embarrassing parking detail. She eventually gives in on a case to find a missing otter, and gets help from a sly fox of the name of Nick Wilde by blackmailing. Nick Wilde is voiced by Jason Bateman. I feel as if the lesson learned from watching this Zootopia is how discrimination tears everyone apart and does not help anything. The voice acting, lip syncing, etc are very convincing. I like how the fox and the bunny's relationship starts out bumpy and then turns into a friendship. I like how determined and motivated the bunny is when it comes to following her dreams. In conclusion, Zootopia is a family friendly movie that teaches good morals and combats discrimination. Overall, I found this movie very pleasant to watch. I highly recommend to anyone to watch this film.

3.5,2016-12-08,"There's been alot of buzz surrounding this movie. All year, in fact. People seem to be attracted to this movie because of it's themes of racism, despite it being a ""family adventure film"". I wonder why that is? Firstly, I find this film to be immensely overrated. It sits on a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes and it seems to be that Zootopia is impossible to hate. Admittedly, it is a great children's film and a movie that adults will also enjoy, and critics seem to agree. This does *not* mean, however, it is a perfect or near-perfect movie. The biggest flaw in Zootopia is that it tries to be a family film, with an underlying theme of racism and prejudice beneath the surface. The problem is, the film lacks a sense of subtlety. This means that the film tries to have its carrot and eat it, giving a lack of focus and a less-than-great performance in each of the areas. The film would have gone better if it had a sense of subtlety but prefers to heighten the mystery just enough to go over kids heads. Another animated movie about the personification of animals, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" managed to nail the balance by using the characters and the theme to build off each other The main character's in Zootopia, a rabbit named Judy Hopps and a fox named Nick Wilde, were the only properly fleshed out characters in the movie. While this makes sense for a buddy-cop film (like this movie is, whether you like it or not) it does not work when you are trying to build a universe, which arguably is one of this film's biggest priorities. Though the chemistry (no pun intended) between the protagonists is quite charming, the other characters are animal-themed cardboard cutouts of what you've already seen before. This film could have been more ambitious with its ideas and message, however it chooses to focus on its main priorities, almost like a movie check-list that needs to be completed. The story, like the character's, and unfortunately quite cliched and mediocre, which is a real shame as I find the setting quite interesting and creative. It makes sense that this would be the case, however like the characters, it too would have benefited in being more interesting and ambitious. The progression is just what you'd expect from a film of the buddy-cop variety and the editing is just fine, though the twist at the end, which I'm not going to spoil, can be seen from a mile off. Zootopia is a fine, if conventional, animated movie that unfortunately tries a little too hard to be something it's not. Despite all the criticism's I've given it, it still has all the infectious Disney charm that we've come to know and love. Though the characters and story is somewhat cliched, it is built upon and built upon quite well. Kids are gonna love it anyway and adults will probably still enjoy it.

4.5,2016-11-27,"I may be the last person on the planet to have finally watched Zootopia, Disney's first quarter hit of the year, and I am very glad that I did. I was expecting something cute with the premise of a plucky rabbit (voiced winningly by Ginnfer Goodwin) joining forces with a wily grifter fox (Jason Bateman) in the big animal metropolis, but what I wasn't expecting was a fully thought out and stupendously imaginative world and a message that is just as thought out and pertinent. The anthropomorphic animal land is filled with colorful locations and plenty of amusing characters. It's highly amusing just to sit back and watch. I knew I was in for something radically different and dare I say more ambitious when there was an N-word approximation joke within the first ten minutes. This was not a moving to be taken lying down. My attention was rewarded with an engaging relationship between the two leads, careful plotting, endlessly clever asides without relying upon an inordinate amount of pop-culture references, and ultimately a noble and relevant message about the power of inclusion, tolerance, and rejecting prejudice. The larger metaphor seems slightly muddied by the late reveal of who is behind the conspiracy to make the animals go feral, but I wouldn't say it undercuts the film's power. The characters charmed me and I was happy that each ecosystem factored into the story in fun and interesting ways. There are plenty of payoffs distributed throughout the movie to make it even more rewarding. Zootopia is a funny, entertaining, heartfelt, and immersive movie with great characters and a world I'd like to explore again. Given its billion-dollar success, I imagine a return trip will be in short order and we should all be thankful. Something this spry and creative needs to be appreciated.

But once she gets on the force she encounters condescension from her superiors, not really listened to, and is generally seen as a political stunt by the mayor. Our bunny rabbit heroine, who's a not so subtle stand-in for women's rights, then enters a city that is not as terrific as she imagined. She finds stores refusing service to certain species, she finds a city that's segregated by animal types, and general open discrimination and negative views of certain animals (they even talk about certain animals being biologically predisposed to be savages). But that all is the intelligent subtext of a film that on the surface level is funny, populated with charming characters, and a visual delight. Our bunny rabbit heroin, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin, begins investigating a rash of animals turning savage. She enlists the help of a con man fox, voiced by Jason Bateman, who has a bit of a chip on his shoulder by how most residents of Zootopia view foxes. There are also some very funny voice work by Idris Elba as a police captain, Bonnie Hunt as Goodwin's mother, Tommy Chong as a stoner water buffalo, J.K.

Some great little in-jokes and use of the different characteristics of the different animals. Nice story too, with some very engaging plots and characters. Some clever pop-cultural references too (eg The Godfather, Breaking Bad). Behind it all is a great anti-prejudice, anti-racism message which is conveyed very effectively. Maybe a little too effectively in that it is laid on a bit thick and comes across as preachy. A bit more subtlety was in order, though, for kids, the target demographic of the movie, the level was probably about right.

It draws parallels of a fictional animal world with the our actual human world. Truth is, it's very timely reminiscent of our world in the last year or so. A bunny who think she can be anything (in this case representing all women, or minorities) yet everyone tells her she can't. Of course she does but has the be THE BEST to be taken seriously. Humans have always discriminated. Told groups of people ""you're not good enough, so don't bother"". The top of the ""food chain"" barely performs above par. But if an outsider wants to join the club, they have to prove themselves above and beyond any current limit. Look at Jackie Robinson (first black baseball player), Tiger woods, Alejandro González Iñárritu (best director, twice) and now Hillary Clinton first, woman to hopefully be US President. Say what you will about that woman. But she doesn't give up, even Trump admitted to that. Call me a male feminist, but it's more than that. We need to open our minds and stop self imposing limits. I know, because I do it to myself every day. Maybe I'm inspired for running my third Half Marathon today. But scew it, I've decided I'm now training for the whole thing. We are stronger than we realize. And we don't need AHoles telling us we're the problem or the enemy. So anyway, watch the movie. It has plenty of other messages besides this one.

5.0,2016-10-17,"Every Bunny Wants to Make a Difference One of the best animated Disney productions in years, Zootopia is an insightful, hilarious film that entertains audiences while telling its story with ease and empathy. Parents and children will fall in love with the niche personalities we've come to expect from Disney animated films, yet Zootopia teaches valuable lessons of tolerance, acceptance, consideration, and basic ""human"" sympathy. Directors Bryon Howard and Rich Moore don't fall short of expectations with their high-spirited, good-humored film Zootopia. Ginnifer Goodwin's audacious performance of Judy Hops, an ambitious bunny who is determined to make the world a better place, attracts all audience members that are looking to have a good laugh while becoming engulfed in a zoological world of action and mystery. An eager, young bunny named Judy Hops is in pursuit of leaving behind her uninspiring life of living on a carrot farm to become a police officer in the chaotic city of Zootopia where all forms of animal life (and their ecological environments) are supposedly able to live together in harmony. After graduating at the top of her class from the police academy, Judy has high expectations of becoming the hero that she has always dreamt of. However, that dream is put on hold as she ends up being assigned to the not so thrilling life of a meter made. While performing what seem like meaningless tasks she is confronted by a swindling fox named Nick (Jason Bateman) who may have some crucial information relating to a top priority missing mammal case within the city. Judy and Nick end up becoming perfect examples of how opposites are able to attract by working together to solve the missing mammal case despite only having 48 hours to do so. Racing against the clock, Judy and Nick team up to save the city and identify the culprits. Disney movies oftentimes, are harshly criticized based on there appearance. However, Zootopia is able to portray a conclusive and inspiring message to its audience members which enables each person's imagination to be explored from the outside in. The insightful messages that are portrayed throughout this film are ones that desperately need the attention of society even if they are conveyed in cartoon form. This film is one that is going to have ""Every Bunny"" wanting to make a difference in there lives and in the lives of those around them.",399,en,every bunny want make difference one best animated disney production year zootopia insightful hilarious film entertains audience telling story ease empathy parent child fall love niche personality come expect disney animated film yet zootopia teach valuable lesson tolerance acceptance consideration basic human sympathy director bryon howard rich moore fall short expectation high spirited good humored film zootopia ginnifer goodwin audacious performance judy hop ambitious bunny determined make world better place attracts audience member looking good laugh becoming engulfed zoological world action mystery eager young bunny named judy hop pursuit leaving behind uninspiring life living carrot farm become police officer chaotic city zootopia form animal life ecological environment supposedly able live together harmony graduating top class police academy judy high expectation becoming hero always dreamt however dream put hold end assigned thrilling life meter made performing seem like meaningless task confronted swindling fox named nick jason bateman may crucial information relating top priority missing mammal case within city judy nick end becoming perfect example opposite able attract working together solve missing mammal case despite hour racing clock judy nick team save city identify culprit disney movie oftentimes harshly criticized based appearance however zootopia able portray conclusive inspiring message audience member enables person imagination explored outside insightful message portrayed throughout film one desperately need attention society even conveyed cartoon form film one going every bunny wanting make difference life life around,2016-10,229,3.1440747839088874
5.0,2016-10-17,"Zootopia: A change in Animation Zootopia doesn't just give the viewers a simple lesson or just some entertainment for young children 8 years and up. The film Zootopia is very different from other Walt Disney Studio films, such as Frozen and Wreck-it Ralph. It shows a different, but much unexpected, plot that is displayed to the audience. From the missing mammals vanishing and a rookie cop befriending a slick fox to help out with the case, this film offers so much more than just a simple Disney movie to have children sing along. However, for a family movie, Zootopia touches base on so many levels of comprehension that engages the viewer in suspense and excitement. Nevertheless, the film gives children a sense of accomplishing what they want to do when they grow up, just as the character Judy Hopps did. Furthermore, this isn't the only great thing about the film. From the films explicit beauty and rarely seen techniques, Zootopia is a very authentic film and creative film. The films major city, Zootopia, includes 12 unique ecosystems, such as the tundra, the rain forest, and urban environments. The rain forest was very green with very large trees. From the trees were sprinklers that looked like tree branches. When the main character (Judy Hopps played by Ginnifer Goodwin) looked down, you can see various species of animals, such as zebras, elephants, and tigers, walking with very colorful umbrellas. The setting was very calm and exciting. Each ecosystem had its own weather and every animal from predator to prey was welcomed in each ecosystem. The tiny animals, such as mice, had their own gated community, with their tiny markets and shopping centers, such as Mousy' (which is in reality Macy's) and trains, but they are still welcomed outside of their community. The way everything is set up in the movie was so awe-inspiring that it actually makes you smile in amazement. But that's not the only thing that's amazing. The relativity of the film brings together real life events or situations so well. Roxana Hadadi observes that, ""The friction felt between the disenfranchised prey species and the more-powerful predator species in a society that is built to favor the latter certainly brings to mind questions about a race and power that have been in the news over the past few years."" The movie displayed some stereotyping with terms, such as calling a bunny cute or touching the hair on a sheep. Nevertheless, Judy Hopps was stereotyped for her size because everyone on the force was large and muscular, such as an Elephant, Polar Bear, Wolf, Rhino, Tiger, and/or Cheetah and a bunny was no use to them. She was even seen as the most hated person in the law enforcement due to her job, which was the lowest job to be given. Even though she was ranked at the top of her class in the police academy and was chosen to be assigned to Precinct 1, city center by the Mayor himself, that didn't matter to the Chief of the Precinct at all. The Chief didn't want a bunny at his Precinct at all. But that's not all the film has displayed. In the film, diversity began between the prey and predators. There has, also, been protest being shot on the News about the situation that has been going on in Zootopia among the predator family's biology and of what Judy Hopps had stated about it. Further, in the protest, a prey had harshly insulted a predator verbally. For example, one prey has said to a cheetah that was protesting for peace among prey and predator in Zootopia with other predators and prey, saying, ""Go back to the Rainforest!"", and the cheetah responded back, saying, ""I'm from the Savannah!"" Judy Hopps knew that she had to fix Zootopia at that point. The film is no ordinary film where the Hero is always successful, instead, the Hero has problems as well. Roxanna Hadadi describes Judy Hopps character as, ""idealistic, driven, with a chip on her shoulder that drives her to help the underdog, she's a perfect hero,"" then she continues to add, ""Until you realize that she has shortcomings, misconceptions, and stereotypes just like anyone else."" Nevertheless, the character of Judy Hopps was always determined to prove herself, stating to the chief of the Precinct, ""I caught the bad guy...I want to be a police officer."" Roxana Hadadi emphasizes that, ""To prove to her doubting family and skeptical colleagues that she's picked the right career, Judy volunteers to help find one of the 14 missing mammals. With 48 hours from her boss to crack the case, she needs Nick's knowledge of Zootopia's inner workings and underworld- whether he wants to help or not."" Judy Hopps basically had to find the missing mammal before the 48 hours were up or she will have to resign. Stacking her job on the case. Some may challenge the view of the character's role. Even claiming that the characters in the film are jokes. However, this claim carries little weight, due to the scene in the film of Judy Hopps taking her police training seriously and proving to her doubting parents and colleagues that she can become a police officer and she did. That scene shows determination and determination isn't a joke at all. Though a viewer, J. Olson, may point out that, ""in the world of Zootopia all DMV workers are sloths,"" that isn't exactly the type of joke others are thinking about. Many people that go to a DMV has to wait in line for a long time and in the film, by putting sloths in the DMV shows that exactly. That scene there is to entertain the audience, and is possibly saying that those working in the DMV can be compared to sloths. Roxana Hadadi claims that, ""Zootopia does a good job fleshing out Hopps so fully that you can't help but root for her."" Of course, many will probably disagree that the film Zootopia is a funny film with some action. However, this argument seems to ignore the pros of the film which is supported by Roxana Hadadi by stating, ""As nuanced as that exploration in in Zootopia, there are other elements of the film that feel surprisingly dated, like a subplot lifted directly from 'The Godfather' and a character modeled after Snooki from the MTV reality show 'Jersey Shore'."" Then she goes on to state that, ""Those flaws keep Zootopia from perfection, but what it does pull off- from its excellently actualized main characters to how it addresses current polices- is mighty impressive enough."" Though a film is not perfect in every way, the upsides is what makes the film extremely exquisite. Even though J. Olson states, ""The funny thing about Walt Disney Animation Studios Zootopia is that it isn't that funny, or straightforward, or anything moviegoers have come to associate with Disney brand,"" this film wasn't technically made to be straightforward, however, it was made to entertain and provide a lesson to the audience. If the film was straightforward like other unanimated movies, then the film wouldn't be very entertaining to the audience, instead, it wouldn't be a Walt Disney Animation at all. Being said, Zootopia is a very artistic movie with an outstanding approach to society. Instead of a baby movie that targets children from the ages 8 years old and below, the movie gives each age group a little taste of excitement. The bunny cop and the sneaky fox was a great touch; making the characters acceptable to the audience, especially the children, but with maturity in their actions. It seems to show reality in child's perspective, but have deeper meaning in an adult's view point. The film also makes an amazing approach in the climax that grasps the viewers' attention due to the suspenseful attitude in the musical selection. The structure of the film and the roles of the characters makes this a ""To See"" movie for all age groups. Taking a different approach in the Walt Disney Studio Productions, this movie was clearly a success and hope to see more of it. Work cited ""Zootopia."" Rev. of Movie, by Roxana Hadadi. n.d.: n. pag.

3.5,2016-10-10,"Review: I was quite impressed with this animation movie from Disney, because it looked great and there was actually a decent storyline which kept me glued to the screen. The various characters kept the film interesting, and the attention to detail was truly amazing. After watching the bonus material on the disk, it's shocking to see how far the production team went to get each of the animals exactly right. From all of the individual hairs on the animals bodies, to there various mannerisms and face expressions, it really is a touch of genius, which is made Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) dramatic journey in the police force, a joy to watch. Personally, I think the movie got better once the fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) was introduced to the film and I liked Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), who gave Judy hell when she first joined the force. There really is something for everyone, and judging by the profits it made at the box office, these new Disney characters went down a storm around the world. I was more impressed with the look and feel of the film, than the actually storyline but I'm sure that I will enjoy the concept more, when I watch it again. I just hope they bring these characters back to the big screen soon. Enjoyable! Round-Up: It's not very often that a movie has 3 directors but in this case, with the amount of different elements involved, I can completely understand. The first director, Byron Howard, 47, brought Bolt and Tangled to the big screen, and he also directed, the short, Tangled Ever After. Rich Moore brought Wreck-It-Ralph to the big screen, and he directed 17 episodes of the Simpson between 1990-1993 and 5 episodes of Futurama. He plans to release a sequel to Wreck-It-Ralph but that won't hit the big screen until 2018. You know how long these animation movies take to produce! Anyway, this is the first movie directed by the final director Jared Bush, and judging by the final product, they worked very well together. With John Lasseter, 59, in the production chair, the creator of Pixar, this movie is definitely one that you can watch time and time again. It currently stands as the 24th biggest movie of all time, so I would definitely say that it's worth a watch. Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $1Billion I recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, the voices by Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Bonnie Hunt and J.K.

5.0,2016-10-08,"In retrospect, it's rather incredible that Zootopia currently stands as the number two box office film of 2016 with over a billion dollars in ticket sales. Frankly, a movie this on the nose about hard hitting political topics shouldn't have even been able to make it out of the gates, much less into family audiences but somehow, Zootopia cracked every nut. I know hardcore conservative families and everyone in between and they have all loved this film. And don't get me wrong, Zootopia is charming, funny and well made with a bevy of hilarious pop culture references that are expertly crafted. However, at the same time, Zootopia is a straight up cultural critique, both of the blatant racism of the right and the delusional talk only attitude of the left. Get past the cute fuzziness and this movie is a savage, incredibly clever and exceptionally well timed critique aimed at voters and party bigwigs on both sides right as we nosed into election year. Incredibly, in a rare testament to corporate Disney's brainchild, the movie is original, enjoyable and a thinker all at the same time. I won't poke too hard at the analogy or read too much into Disney's ulterior motives because ultimately, I think this movie really needed to be made regardless.

So I'm going to do my best to dispel a myth about this film! Is Zootopia some kind of liberal propaganda machine from Disney? No, It isn't! And here's why! The major plot point at the beginning of the film centers around Judy a female from a rual area that dreams of becoming a cop. The key is here that no where does Judy get anything handed to her! No, she is treated the same as everyone else in the academy and has to work very hard to get where she is! And even when she gets on the force she has to again work hard to get what she wants! These aren't liberal values their American values! And something many are obviously taking for granted when they type out such nonsense! Learn to think for yourself! Don't be a sheep and follow along with what someone else is saying! This might I add is another value that Zootopia teaches and it is at its core not liberal! I could go further into detail but I feel I've made my point! Let's just say that yes Zootopia is a great film and everyone should keep an open mind and watch it! The world isn't black and white, nor is Zootopia! And sometimes if you really pay attention to things you might just see things weren't as clear cut as you might of thought. Lastly I'm no liberal myself. Nor am I conservative!

5.0,2016-10-05,"Alex Schrampfer English 110 MA 1 Kopplin 10/4/16 Zootopia, a movie produced by a company known for producing tear jerking movies (Disney), had to be great or it would be viewed as a disappointment. It certainly did a stellar job at living up to the company's reputation. Zootopia is overall a masterpiece with which offers an appeal to all ages with its brilliant humor, great lessons, and with computer animation that is jaw dropping. In the animated world of Zootopia animals run their world just like how humans run this world. A bunny named Judy Hopps is determined from a young age to become a police officer. Which may not seem so tough, but in a world where only predators are police officers it makes it immensely more difficult. With a strong personality and ambition, she believes that she can accomplish anything she wants despite all the adversity. Through determination, Judy starts to break down barriers that will teach kids that anything can be accomplished with the right attitude. Even though many obstacles stand in her way of becoming an officer and solving her first case, she in unwilling to throw in the towel that almost all others would. Even though the movie is geared to younger children, it is also enjoyable for adults. With rips on the sloth like speed of the Department of Motor Vehicles and to references to The Godfather, it'll cause all audiences to want to dwell in the fictional world. The fictional world in this movie is awe inspiring but that doesn't mean the movie was perfect. At times the humor got a little dry and they would repeat jokes so it felt as though they were beating a dead horse. Making another Disney film that doesn't remind one of another one can be a rather daunting task. But overall Zootopia took an interesting spin on a fairly simple plot. Even though the script was simple it never was forced and it was hard to see lines coming. There is nothing more that will help a movie than backstory. Backstory sets the stage for everything and causes many people to root for certain characters that they normally wouldn't have. This movie is great for kids because the movie addresses problems like: stereotyping, racial profiling, and discrimination. But it does it in such a way that it is so subtle that it's for children to know they are watching an informative movie. Everyone enjoys watching creative and imaginative movies. More reasons why Zootopia is so enjoyable to watch. The movie takes audiences into a wonderful world which completely entices them into the landscape of Zootopia. Whether Judy is weaving her way through traffic that dwarfs her or trudging through a rainforest, audiences are left infatuated with this pulchritudinous world. Unfortunately, one cannot dwell in this utopia forever. Overall the movie was a great see but also a learning experience. Movie is open to all ages but it is more geared to younger children. No one would be surprised if this movie ended up winning an Oscar. Audience: Define your audience as specifically as you can. My paper was geared more towards parents/adults. I was assuming most younger children weren't going to look up am movie review. I geared it towards parents so they know what they are getting themselves into before going to the theater with their children. I also geared it towards adults because it was easy enough to included adults with parents. List three things you did in this review in order to communicate with this audience? Talked about some of the jokes that would go right over the heads of kids. I Talked straight at the parents and how this is a learning experience for kids but also for adults.

Which, she does by graduating at the top of her class. Her first day doesn't go so well. After all of her colleagues are assigned to a missing person case, Judy is assigned to meter maid.

5.0,2016-09-24,"I've read many reviews here before posting this one and one thing I see time and time again is people complain about the films message. Really? People ATCUALLY get offended by a film trying to present something postive for a change! So let's outline what it could be: Living up to your fullest potential and never giving up. Treating others that might just be diffent than you with respect (the golden rule). Not bullying others. Being kind hearted and striving to be a good person. These are basically the messages from this film! And unless you are stuck on picking apart them and are LOOKING FOR THEM you'll very likely not notice! And several other professional critics have already mentioned, Zootopia IS NOT HEAVEY HANDED with its message! And unless you're reading politics into this film it should not cause you to dislike it! These arguments are both ridiculous and childish! What Zootopia is, is a wonderfully animated and heartfelt story of working hard to reach your goals and a unlikely friendship of two indviduals from very diffent backgrounds. It's animation is amazing, it's character development and world building are some of the best I've ever seen in my 40 years of life, it's voice casting fits perfectly and everyone went above and beyond to give a special performance to their respective character, and its story is as heartfelt, emotional, and all around fun as they come! Zootopia deserves the honor it has recived so far and it's not the top rated film of 2016 on Rotten Tomotes because it was lazily thrown together. This film will win many awards early next year and likely pick up the top honor of winning a Oscar! And you know what? It deserves it!

5.0,2016-09-22,"Disney Does it Again With Zootopia! The Disney film Zootopia is set in a world where animals have evolved and now live much like humans do. The film Zootopia centers on the rabbit with a big dream, the up beat, lovable, Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin (Walk the Line, Once Upon a Time). Judy Hopps was a small town rabbit with dreams of being a respected and loved police officer, who moves to the city Zootopia. While Judy is indeed successful in becoming a cop, notably the first ever rabbit to do so, she is still overlooked by everyone, including Police Chief Bogo, voiced by Idris Elba (Pacific Rim, The Jungle Book) and assigned to parking duty. However, Judy takes it upon herself to begin an investigating. A series of local disappearances, Judy needs the help of Nick Wilde, voiced by Jason Bateman (Starksy and Hutch, Horrible Bosses), a con artist fox she had previously encountered. With her job on the line, the two begin to discover the disappearances in Zootopia are tied into a conspiracy and a cover-up involving some locals. ""The Big D"", better known as Disney has 80 years or more of experience making animated films, so saying that Disney has made another family film is not anything particularly noteworthy. It is what we have come to expect. While best known for their musicals, princesses, and prince charming, Disney animation has been on a roll of late with animated movies with a message. Like the Academy Award winning Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph. However, Zootopia is not simply another fun Disney animated movie. It is one of the greatest Disney animated movies I have seen in the last ten years. From a technical standpoint, Zootopia is top notch. The animation is gorgeous. All of the animals look spectacular. Each creature looks alive, real, and emotional on screen. Action scenes are fun, exciting, and a joy to watch. I have not seen Disney to great-animated action sequences like this since Toy Story 2. The action scenes will have you gasping, on the edge of your seat, and invested in the moment. The world is so colorful, bold, and a world you actually want to invest in. Accordingly, the voice cast works well. In addition to Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman we get the talents of J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man, Whiplash), Idris Elba, and musical artist Shakira, among others. Every actor and character is perfectly matched! To Heavy of a Message for a Kids Film? The story is so much more than just a buddy cop film, between a fox and a rabbit. The film is clever, has great inside reference jokes, there are a lot of jokes for adults that will go way over kids' head (references to The Godfather, the DMV, and Breaking Bad, for instance), but there's plenty for younger audiences to laugh at, too, and it all comes wrapped in great messages about courage, empathy, tolerance, teamwork, and the dangers of reducing others to stereotypes. I know this is a kid's movie, and this may not be politically correct. But, this movie has cojones (I'm talkin' 'bout balls)! For a kid's film to tackle on the subject of race, stereotypes, relations, profiling, discrimination and bullying is really brave. Everyone can connect to this movie, and that what makes it beautiful. You can view it multiple times, and still learn something new. Something new about yourself, something new about society, some new jokes, overall something amazing every time for kids and adults. My only complaint about this film is, for a kid's movie, it is a little lengthy. Also, I am not sure if kids will understand the entire message, and laugh as much as they would like to. So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Zootopia. It is Clever and heartwarming, it has vibrant visuals, an amazing storyline, and a message for the world. A message that we as a society cannot fully grasp, but an animated movie helps us along the way. This is why I like movies. They teach, inspire, and make us connected. Also, Shakira plays a singing pop star Gazelle in the movie. I thought I would never say this, but that was a sexy gazelle! I believe the Disney film Zootopia earns a... 5/5!

3.5,2016-09-19,"One of the most recent additions to the billion dollar box office club, it's safe to say Disney would be quite happy with the performance of their animated hit Zootopia. A film filled to the brim with colour, life and a pace that barely allows you to question the ethics behind an animated film having references to Uber, Breaking Bad and religion (not to mention a nudist club), Bryon Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush's film is an animated tale perfectly suited to today's climate of acceptance and feminist driven protagonists and with its skewering to those a little older than the average Disney target, Zootopia is thankfully a film adults can find themselves enjoying while the rugrats take in the sights and sounds of a world run by animals of all shapes and sizes. Zootopia begins in a seemingly run of the mill fashion as determined little bunny Judy Hopps (voiced with energy by Ginnifer Goodwin) decides she's going to shun her carrot loving heritage to become a police officer, but Zootopia quickly morphs into a fairly intriguing mystery as Judy finds herself teaming up with the on face value dastardly fox Nick Wilde (voiced to perfection by Jason Bateman) to solve the disappearance of a raft of animals from the city. It's nice to have an animated film steer away from the overused hero's v villains stereotypes that have infested the animated staples of recent years and while the film reverts back to a sadly rather generic finale, Zootopia has done enough in the lead up that we don't really mind to much at all. Perhaps slightly undeserving of some of the high praise it received upon release at years start, Zootopia is still undoubtedly a whole lot of fun for the whole family even though some of the younger members of the clan may not exactly get what on earth is going on at times.

To give you an idea a single giraffe has more individual hairs on it-nine million-than every single character in either Frozen, Big Hero 6, or Wreck-It Ralph! Another example is Elsa's hair in Frozen had about 400,000 strands. But Zootopia pushes that further. A mouse in Zootopia has 480,000 hairs, while a giraffe has about 9 million. That means crazy computing power was needed, to animate and render each individual frame-and some took up to 100 hours to do, once they were fully realized. Real looking fur also has a lot to do with ambient movement. When an animal is running, obviously air is moving in a very specific direction. But if the character is just standing there, there's movement too, it's just much more subtle. For Zootopia, software called xGen was given a whole new set of tools that built in an ambient, natural movement into the scenes. It worked on hair, as well as the environments, so that everything in the film that can move, is always moving. This is something that was impossible just a couple of years ago! So in fact Zootopia is pretty groundbreaking technology wise! Zootopia also has 64 different species of animals, that break down into about 800,000 different character models. And not a single one was a copy of the other. The amount of time and attention to detail in this film is just amazing! Take a look again when Judy comes into Zootopia and just look at all those characters! It's a city full of life and this is something that's pretty amazing! Zootopia has a message everyone needs to hear: Inside Zootopia real look at what happens when different people and cultures find themselves crammed together in the same space. It's not always peaceful, and it's not pretty. Bias, and outright prejudice, exist. Some is overt, much is born from fear, and some comes from the most well-meaning of places, from those who simply don't think their actions through. It has a strong anti-bulling message: Bellwether: Bellwether reveals that Lionheart bullies her with a derogatory name, and actually sees little to no value in her. To him, she is just an insignificant, under appreciated prey. Little does Lionheart know, Bellwether is also incredibly underestimated. The sheep is later revealed to be the antagonist behind attempting to plunge the city into chaos. She does so under the belief that she can avenge the victimized prey and eliminate predators entirely. She hoped to use fear to turn others to destroy her bullies, ultimately grouping predators into the same, demonized category.  Bellwether allowed bullying to break her. She decided that the best form of payback was vengeance. She took the law into her own malicious hands, and it ultimately led to her downfall. She became the bully she sought to punish, and it brought her to ruin. Nick: The audience first sees him as a conman, scheming to illegally profit from the inhabitants of Zootopia. As we later learn, Nick has a very pessimistic approach on life. He has a very pessimistic outlook on life, and it stems from the trauma he endured as a child. In his youth, Nick was going to be the first predator boy scout. However, his dreams are shattered when the rest of the troop hazes him. They shove and hit him in the darkness before fastening a muzzle to his face. All of these traumatic actions are inflicted while one of the prey verbally abuses him, saying that he will never be more than an untrustworthy predator. The incident ends with Nick ripping off the harness and crying. While Nick does allow this incident to corrupt him, he does not incite violence as Bellwether did. Instead, he turns on himself. He believes every negative opinion about himself and decides to live under the label he was given. If the world would always see him as nothing more than a untrustworthy fox, there was no reason to even try and be anything else. He is cynical and degrading towards Judy, who has just moved in. In a sense, he sees himself in her. He sees that eager young face that believed in possibility, and is under the illusion that is he cannot succeed, no one else can. It would later take Judy's persistence to help him find the confidence within himself. Nick exemplifies those who choose to let others set their standards. Judy: Judy is someone who will never say die. She faces the most trials in the entire story. If anyone had a right to quit under pressure, it would be her. From her youth, Judy ignites a dream to become the first rabbit police officer in the history of the world. At the beginning of the story, we see her parents persuading her to settle down and give up such dreams. Her father does not enforce resilience at all, and stresses to stop trying and stay in comfort zones. While this is not necessarily bullying, it is a moment that defines Judy. Sometimes parental advice is not in the best interests of the child. While some may be like Judy, and choose to ignore such words, others may believe them. Many people have their dreams crushed because they believe every limit and enforcement that parents label him or her with.  Moments later, Judy stands up for weaker children getting bullied by Gideon Grey, a hulking fox. He shoves her to the ground, and she ends up hitting him back. As much as Judy stands up for herself, Gideon ends up slashing her across the face, and traumatizing her by saying that she will never be more than a stupid bunny. This incident resembles Nick's boy scout hazing. Unlike Nick, Judy refuses to let anyone define who she is except herself. She remains true to her passions and refuses to believe anyone else. She understands that someone's opinion does not have to become a reality. This understanding allows Judy to overcome the odds and make history as the first officer. Her trials continue in the workplace, where Police Chief Bogo immediately discriminates her. He disregards her academic achievements and assigns her to parking duty. He openly admits to not caring what Judy has done or where she comes from. Rather than hope to exact revenge on the chief or believe his label, Judy strives to disprove him. He says she can mark one hundred tickets, so she does two hundred. She embodies the belief in performing your best regardless of your position in life. Prior to her breakthrough moment, Judy is nearly discouraged by her own parents and Nick. Still, she is able to stay true to herself, and ultimately save Zootopia. In the process, her actions are able to inspire Nick to overcome his fears become a police officer. Judy does not let bullying define her. She acknowledges it, and moves forward to prove to herself what she is capable of. Why Zootopia matters: Zootopia deserves all of the credit it gets. I believe it is a breakthrough film with the potential to help children and adults alike better understand the world. And it is my hope that those who watch this film find the courage to move on from past pains and insecurities. I hope they make the world a better place. The time of competition and envy is over, such as this ongoing argument that Kubo is the better film! As Judy puts it at the end of the film, change starts with us. Help people and believe in all that you are. You are not limited by what others tell you. You are the valiant result of endurance and progression. You are still here. You are still valuable. Make this world a better place, and try everything to do so. Whether it's helping one person or a thousand. Whether it's proving you can achieve the impossible, or you fought to get up this morning. You matter. Others see it, you should too.",1428,en,zootopia feature wonderfully imaginative joyfully expressive animation also contains consistently smart humor instantly lovable interesting character remarkable

2.5,2016-09-06,"I mean, I get it. The movie is trying to relay an important message onto youngsters about equality and it's all very good and well. But there are far too many times the movie gets confused with the notion of 'patronising' for it to be credible. Take the ice cream hustle scene which seems to reflect certain attitudes towards race, and then flips it completely by proving to us that fox's are indeed sly by nature. It can't decide how far it is committed to the political message, and that's a really big distraction, not to mention lazy! This totally undermines what could be a decent narrative, but one that is ultimately convoluted by the shoehorning of its message. Humour wise, the film works on kids humour (as expected) so don't expect belly laughs, aside from the sloth character around a third of the way through. The CGI is great, obviously, it's a Disney movie and the voice acting goes without any major bumps. The universe is beautiful to look at, but so vast and unexplored that it makes you wonder why they bring it up in the first place. In fact, a lot of the movie has a lot of characters speaking about a lot of stuff that delivers very little pay off. And that's Zootopia's resounding problem: the directors ambition to make it more than a Disney film for kids, but also having to, y'know, make a Disney film for kids.

4.5,2016-09-04,"Since 1937 Walt Disney Studios cinematic history with the release of the first feature-length animated movie, 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'. Back then many people consider this just very long cartoon and denying it the same respect as a live-action film. It was only recently that the Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences designated a separate best picture Oscar the animated film. Dominating this category from the very start is the Walt Disney Studios, continuing to maintain their position or supremacy in the art form they began. Whenever a new movie is announced fans and critics alike know that this a few things that will be certain; it is going to be one of the highest rated movies of the season in its box office is going to approach staggering heights previously unimaginable. The latest movie from the House of Mouse clearly demonstrates these facts, 'Zootopia'. Universally acclaimed by the critical community the opinion of the fan base is clearly demonstrated by his nearly $1 billion in box office running in an undisputed place in the record books. This is the 55th movie in the ever-growing 'Disney Animated Canon', and it builds upon the theme that has been consistent throughout long cinematic reign. There's something new with anthropomorphizing animals. As a significant place in almost every religion and mythology the coaches have embraced throughout time. The Disney studios are no strangers to humanized animals carrying the story but this film takes things to a completely different level. 'Zootopia' is set in an alternate reality where most major types of mammals are sentient and have constructed their own civilization. In many ways it mirrors our own was the many allegorical connections to humanity are present in typical Disney fashion they represent an undercurrent that may be discerned by adults but in no way will interfere with the enjoyment of audience members of any age. So many movies claim to be family films but the either have nothing to really hold the adult interests making it a chore to sit next your children while watching. This movie is the epitome of an entertainment and instruction in such a fashion that there is something contained within it that will hold the attention of everybody from the younger sister the grandparents. Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a young rabbit was smart and ambitious. She is from the small rural town of Bunnyburrow, making her the archetypical idealistic girl from a small town looking to succeed in the big city. She diligently applied herself to her studies in the Zootopia police Academy graduating as valedictorian. She hopes that this will put her in position to become the first female officer in the city. Instead of police work that you work so hard to master Judy is relegated to the traffic division is little more than a meter maid. Her boss, Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Elba), a Cape buffalo, is hidebound to the old tradition of no female officers and despite Judy's formidable Scholastic record doubts her ability to do real police work. First day on the job did not do much to change the opinion of the male establishment. Judy finds itself outmaneuvered by a pair of boxer criminals, Nick Wilde (voiced by Bateman) and his fellow con artist, Tom Finnick (voiced by Tiny Lister). A next day she tries to redeem herself by abandoning her and traffic detail and arresting a known thief, Duke Weaselton (voiced by Alan Tudyk) who stole some flower bulbs, a change of his usual crime of bootleg DVDs. Rather than the accolades the chief chastises her for neglecting her assignment. Just then something happens that is going to change Judy's career path and drive the remainder of the story. An older female, Mrs. Otterton (voiced by Octavia Spencer) we need somebody to help her find her missing husband, Emmitt Otterton. As so often is the case in this movie the name is a reference to his species is both wife and missing husband are both North American river otters. In all cases a great deal of effort is given into property representing different species maintaining as many of the animal attributes as possible by portraying them in an anthropomorphic fashion. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this story, at least for the grown-ups, is how well is simulates a typical police procedural specifically the perennial favor the mismatched buddy flick. Judy needs to come up with some way to get the investigation moving so when she discovers that Nick was the last one to see the missing Otterton she realizes his assistance is crucial. She tricks him into confessing to tax evasion and subsequently leverages his reluctant cooperation by blackmailing the criminally inclined fox. These tactics are on a level far in advanced of what a child could fully comprehend and are obviously targeting the parents. Kidnapping, tax evasion, blackmail and gender prejudice are not the typical plot devices found in the traditional family movie but it is consistent with the trend Disney has been following for decades of not talking down to the audience. As far as the kids are concerned smart Judy has tricked the mischievous fox in to helping her solve the case. The grown-ups will undoubtedly recognize the contextual similarities to such movies as '24 Hours', or any of a plethora of stories that partner a cop and criminal together. The plot continues in this fashion as additional sub-plots are infused into the story. There is the clue that the missing otter became 'savage', deteriorating into a feral stat as manifested by attacking his chauffeur. While in this state Otterton was ranting about 'night howlers'. This thread is expanded upon encompassing how predators are considered a minority and further more a drug is eventually a drug is proven as responsible for the violent behavior. By utilizing constructs that include stereotyping, bullying, and drug related violence the parallels to the real world are strongly integrated into the story. Perhaps it is intended for some didactic meaning trickle down to the younger audience members but it certainly ensures the story will readily capture and retain the interest of those past their legal maturity. One element that all ages will agree upon as delightfully entertaining it is the animation. Some have noted that there is a predilection for an animated feature to lose much of the warmth and subtle nuances in a film that depends on manually drawing and coloring each frame of the film. At a conservative 24 frames, or cells per second a movie like this with a running tome of 108 minutes requires 155,520 individual cells. Walt Disney has been expert at breathing a sense of humanity onto their animation for several decades. You will find yourself forgetting that you are so caught up watching the antics of a bunny and a fox or that this story takes place in a city entirely populated by a myriad of talking animals. Topping it off is this is another excursion into the technological advances of 3D. Many filmmakers and studios are devoting considerable time and resources into creating the illusion of depth but extremely few have been so affective in achieving the feeling that it realistically contributes to the process of telling the story and enhancing its enjoyment for everyone.",1219,en,since walt disney studio cinematic history release first feature length animated movie snow white

5.0,2016-08-22,"It was unfortunate that I didn't get to see this film in theaters. It would have made an amazing experience with the huge screen. Instead, I rented it from Netflix and watched it in the comfort of my own home on my 32 inch LED television. Even with the smaller screen, I found Zootopia to be absolutely perfect. It seems that every year Disney puts out a rock solid film that breaks barriers in animation. Last year it was ""Inside Out"" and the year before that it was ""Big Hero 6."" To a lesser degree, we even had ""The Jungle Book."" which blew me away in terms of CGI, and I haven't even seen ""Pete's Dragon"" yet. So in this year of movies still to come I will still say that ""Zootopia"" is without a doubt my favorite film of the year so far. It would be hard to see a movie beat this but movies always surprise me. Zootopia is directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore and it's about a bunny rabbit named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) who lives on a carrot farm and dreams of being a police officer. This is frowned upon because bunnies are known for being cute and small and are not taken seriously. She is ambitious and doesn't let anyone tell her otherwise. She eventually goes through the police academy and becomes the best of the bunch. She is then is badged as a cop and moves the city of Zootopia. There she meets a con artist fox by the name of Nick (Jason Bateman) and they work together to find a bunch of animals that went missing in the city. Let's start by talking about the city of Zootopia. It is made up of different ecosystems such as an area of snow, desert, rainforest, and in the heart of it is an urban area. There everything to accommodate for all the human like animals. There is a smaller city for the mice, different doors for different sizes, and various shops and houses. It's all integrated within this city. It's all so carefully detail, interesting, and fun to just watch how the day to day is in this animal metropolis. Will all the different animals occupying this I could just get lost in watching city by itself. The main leads are from Nick and Judy who expressions and voice match perfectly and even though they are animals they feel like real people. Nick is a fox who has a darker past that he isn't so open about but is definitely the funny one of the two. He would say witty things like ""Do you think she counts herself when she sleeps?"" this is a quote about Dawn Bellwether (Jenny Slate) who is a sheep. He is the know it all and the one who knows how criminals work. Probably because he is one. Judy is the heroine in this film who is positive and has high ambitions. She is the perfect example of a successful person. Even when her parents on the farm give her the idea it's okay to settle in life, she doesn't want that because she wants more. She is cute and small (she doesn't like be called ""cute"") but she has a tough side. She very relatable and simply an amazing character. Now this city is filled with so many animals it would difficult to name them all but we are still blessed with an outstanding voice cast. We have voices from Shakira, Nate Torrence, Idris Elba, J.K Simmons, Tommy Chung, Don Lake, Bonnie Hunt, and so many more. They really bring out the life of this crazy city. When it comes to the story the writers and directors just nailed it. It plays like a buddy cop film where we see the partnership unfold during the investigation. We see them find witnesses and run into bad guy all over the city. When they find what they are looking for the story just opens up and brings some thought provoking material that deals with stereotypes, discrimination, and friendship. The story brings up ideas that are relevant to real life and it makes fascinating points that had me pondering after the film was over. There are prey and predators but it's never that black and white and when things start to happen we question that. Of course, there was also the deeply emotional scenes that got to me I did tear up. It's not as emotional as ""Inside Out"" but it still got to me. Aside from that, this is still a fun movie that made me laugh throughout. The pop culture humor mixed with the sharp dialogue and animal puns always made me crack up. I just absolutely loved the sloths at the DMV. If you saw it in the trailer they change it up a little so it's not completely predictable. Alas, we have the final ingredient which is the animation and I say this...It's f******* fantastic! Note: This is not a Pixar film but a Disney Animation Studio film. This is something that is easily unnoticed. Mostly when people see a computer animated film by Disney they associate it with Pixar. Of course with films like ""Tangled""and ""Big Hero 6"" that's not the case. It also doesn't mean that the animation is lesser than Pixar. The detail in here is so rich. The animation is so sharp. Small things like Judy's IPhone, iPod, and her carrot tv dinner look so real it's insane. It was impressed at first but when Judy first comes to Zootopia and she is gazing around this metropolis, there was so many lush colors and awe-inspiring moments. It just had such stellar animation and quality. It was obviously animated with love and attention. The entire movie was made with love. It had everything in it and then some. It was a buddy cop crime film that had emotions, detail, characters, exciting moments, thought-provoking themes, silliness, and is simply fun. It's a film that is pop art and high art. This is a movie that reminds me why I love movies. Movies that offer escapism, intelligence, and entertainment.

4.5,2016-08-17,"Zootopia is about small-town bunny Judy Hopps whose only desire in life is to make it in the big city as a police officer. In the world of Zootopia, bunnies aren't supposed to be police officers. That's a job for the predators and the larger herbivores. Judy doesn't let those stereotypes set her back. Not only does she become a cop, but she gets to prove herself by being assigned a big case that she has forty-eight hours to solve. Animated movies aren't just about fun and games anymore. More often than not, they are appealing to the minds of the adults that have to sit through the movie with their kids. There is something about a message shining through species that aren't human that make the message even more potent in some ways. It allows the viewer to take a step back and see the points for what they are without taking offense. Zootopia is no exception. Among the many things to enjoy about this movie, the message itself stands apart as the most remarkable. During a time where racism is very much alive and well, this movie preaches the power of believing in yourself and overcoming the stigma of negativity. No kidding, you could literally hold a seminar on all the different messages captured in Zootopia. It left me thinking about it for days, hence the late review. The ""many things to enjoy"" I referred to earlier are quite pleasing as well. Disney does an extremely good job of paying attention to detail and their talents are in full effect in Zootopia. As I watched, I thought, ""Man, they really have thought of everything."" Among all the details, I particularly loved Little Rodentia, a district made specifically for the smaller creatures of the city. During a fun chase scene, Judy looks like Godzilla as she is racing through the district trying to catch a bad guy. The characters were done particularly well also. I was a huge fan of Judy's as I followed her through the highs and lows of her struggle to become a police officer then keep that job. Yes, Jason Bateman did a great job as well playing clever fox Nick Wilde. For me, Ginnifer Goodwin stole the show as Judy and gave the movie its heartbeat. The clever mix of characters will keep you laughing but also hit you with touching moments at times. One gripe: In the beginning of the film, we are conditioned to think that the prejudice issue is against one species in particular. Then something else happens that I won't give away and another group is suddenly stereotyped. This threw me off my game a bit as it had me wondering who is against who? But I guess that the ugliness of racism, right? One race gets hated then hates on another race. It's an ugly cycle where no one is innocent. There is a saying: Hurt people hurt people. Going a step further: We act and think the way we do because of how we were taught. How can you expect to ever think differently when you were raised to hate bunnies? These are the types of conversations created that make this movie phenomenal. I give Zootopia a hefty 98.",541,en,zootopia small town bunny judy hopps whose desire life make big city police officer world zootopia bunny supposed police officer job predator larger herbivore judy let stereotype set back become cop get prove assigned big case forty eight hour solve animated movie fun game anymore often appealing mind adult sit movie kid something message shining specie human make message even potent way allows viewer take step back see point without taking offense zootopia exception among many thing enjoy movie message stand apart remarkable time racism much alive well movie preaches power believing overcoming stigma negativity kidding could literally hold seminar different message captured zootopia left thinking day hence late review many thing enjoy referred earlier quite pleasing well disney extremely good job paying attention detail talent full effect zootopia watched thought man really thought everything among detail particularly loved little rodentia district made specifically smaller creature city fun chase scene judy look like godzilla racing district trying catch bad guy character done particularly well also huge fan judy followed high low struggle become police officer keep job yes jason bateman great job well playing clever fox nick wilde ginnifer goodwin stole show judy gave movie heartbeat clever mix character keep laughing also hit touching moment time one gripe beginning film conditioned think prejudice issue one specie particular something else happens give away another group suddenly stereotyped threw game bit wondering guess ugliness racism right one race get hated hate another race ugly cycle one innocent saying hurt people hurt people going step act think way taught expect ever think differently raised hate bunny type conversation created make movie phenomenal give zootopia hefty,2016-08,272,3.221708869971844

3.5,2016-08-14,"Zootopia is brimming with silly, slapstick humor and terrific one-liners - and yes, some simple yet valuable lessons about tolerance and prejudice and learning to embrace our differences. There's nothing wrong with a lesson or two when those lessons are packaged within such a great and memorable film. As crazy as the design of the world is, Zootopia ends up feeling like a genuine place. There's a vibrancy to it that runs through everything from the pace of the storytelling to the background details of the world in which the story takes place. Zootopia is visually rich, with a fully realized cityscape and an action-filled train station during commuter rush that would take several viewings to fully appreciate. It's emotionally rich, too, a film that promises to have staying power far beyond spring break. Zootopia is essentially using a whodunit approach (albeit toning down on the murder) and centers on two mismatched buddies solving a crime together. All time-honored story methods and all done in an engaging manner here, propelled along by two great characters. The brilliantly well-rounded Zootopia offers a thoughtful, inclusive message that's as rich and timely as its sumptuously state-of-the-art animation -- all while remaining fast and funny enough to keep younger viewers entertained. It's one of those movies that truly is able to entertain audiences of all ages, in different ways, and another big accomplishment in the Disney oeuvre. VERDICT: ""High-Quality Stuff"" - [Positive Reaction] This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theatre to see or own on DVD.

Ever since Tangled in 2010 their animated features have been hit after hit, aside from one or two, their Marvel movies have been fantastic, they've put out some hit live action remakes of classic animated features, and now they're going strong with Star Wars. Zootopia continues that trend with yet another excellent animated feature. The movie does a great job using the differences and similarities between the animal species as commentary on the way humans of different groups interact with each other, and uses that to teach a great message, while still remaining really entertaining, and it does it in a way that isn't just goofy cartoon fun, but contains some smart writing that even adults can enjoy.
