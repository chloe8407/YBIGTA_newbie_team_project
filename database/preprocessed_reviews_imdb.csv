I didn't actually see this movie in theaters, but I did rent it and was pleasantly surprised. Not everything is in black and white in this movie, and various stereotypes are broken. And things are not always what they seem. I loved the main characters and they all get my standing ovation.

8,2019-05-02,"""A little bit of kindness goes a long way"" would be a perfect quote for this film.When Judy Hopps, a country rabbit, shoots for her dreams as a part of the police force in Zootopia(Zootropolis), things weren't what she expected it to be. She was forced to face reality for what it truly was. Sound familiar?It may have delivered a couple of messages that people have already heard dozens of times, but that doesn't take away the strength it gives to those who believe that what matters the most is trying to do things right in their lives and in society. I wasn't expecting to find this to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, but that's what it delivered. The ""true"" conflict presented was also as relevant as it was when this film was released. A divide that caused unrest among the ones that should be working towards improving society.One small crutch from the plot was its use of circumstance to move the story along. But overall, this can be overlooked since after all, it isn't only with wits or pure strength alone that would allow a person to find solutions to the problems that they face in their lives.Using cartoons as a medium to convey the kind of messages it did was also a brilliant move on the part of the producer and creators of this film. It would be a good and effective learning material for parents or older people to use to teach young people as a way to prepare and make them understand how the world works.Brilliant movie.",263,en,little bit kindness go long way would perfect quote film judy hopps country rabbit shoot dream part police force zootopia zootropolis thing expected forced face reality truly sound familiar may delivered couple message people already heard dozen time take away strength give believe matter trying thing right life society expecting find source encouragement inspiration delivered true conflict presented also relevant film released divide caused unrest among one working towards improving society one small crutch plot use circumstance move story along overall overlooked since wit pure strength alone would allow person find solution problem face life using cartoon medium convey kind message also brilliant move part producer creator film would good effective learning material parent older people use teach young people way prepare make understand world work brilliant movie,2019-05,128,2.5856464948104785
8,2017-10-10,"This is a wonderful animation film that definitely surprised me! Expecting it to be another average Disney film, I was delighted to find it was not quite so. First of all, the animation is extremely well done which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. The amount of details is astonishing and watching it twice was not a punishment for me. The plot is also surprisingly well thought-of, being funny yet dramatic and it keeps you on your seat while also making you laugh multiple times. Although a city full of anthropomorphic animals that dress and act like humans has been extremely popular since animation existed, I believe this Disney movie takes it to a new level. It really does feel like everything took years to develop as the environment is complex and believable and the animal characters resemble their real-life counterparts remarkably well. It's amazing how they could produce a movie with simple jokes suitable for kids yet still silently addressing real-life issues at the same time. At last, I definitely recommend this movie for the whole family as I deem it enjoyable for all ages.",186,en,wonderful animation film definitely surprised expecting another average disney film delighted find quite first animation extremely well done make movie enjoyable watch amount detail astonishing watching twice punishment plot also surprisingly well thought funny yet dramatic keep seat also making laugh multiple time although city full anthropomorphic animal dress act like human extremely popular since animation existed believe disney movie take new level really feel like everything took year develop environment complex believable animal character resemble real life counterpart remarkably well amazing could produce movie simple joke suitable kid yet still silently addressing real life issue time last definitely recommend movie whole family deem enjoyable age,2017-10,106,2.773164176067193
10,2019-05-13,"Zootopia is a 3D animation movie produced by Walt Disney. Zootopia is a big city over there. Like its name, this city contains all animal characters such a zoo as well. We can find so many animal characters here and of course they bring their own characteristics. They are rabbits, foxes, goats, sheeps, wolfs, lion, sheep, rhinoceros, and any others. And the main character is a bunny or we know it as a rabbit called Judy Hopps. Ya, just a little rabbit who has wanted to be a policewoman since she was child while there was no rabbit be police. There is no matter if the citizen are just rabbits, but the problem is the citizen are not only rabbits but all of animals are over there. There are many big and strong animals such rhinoceros or lions who are more appropriate to be police than just a bunny. She had been underestimated by every one for dreaming to be police, even by her parents. But it was not a problem for her, even she must pass many difficulties, she just kept trying and trying and finally she got appreciation to be the best police since she could finish a mission of a case and found something new on it.1. Animation
The animation moving is very smooth such as another 3D animation movie. The characters are drawn well, suit to their characteristic. We can know directly how is a character's feature even just see them, not watch them. It run a same way when some characters turn characteristic, from good to bad or vice versa, we can know it directly by their expression. It eases children to know how feature of the characters are, so they won't be confused by watching this movie especially when some characters change their appanage. This movie has a beautiful color, contras but still in harmony and it makes gazer, from children to adult, be able to enjoy this movie well.
2. Score
For me, every single sound in this movie is nice, very nice. From the dubbing, sound effect, and of course the sound track. The sound track, Try Everything by Shakira, is very representative that movie and it suits when it played while Judy Hopps was enjoying her journey from her hometown to Zootopia. So, we, as gazer, can enjoy both of picture and the song.
3. Plot twist
This is the most unexpected part of this movie when Mrs. Bellwether changed into a bad character. In the beginning, she was very good and helpful to Judy, but it turned out that she was a mastermind of all of ""disaster"" in the movie. This part gives us some breaks when we have a bit been bored think who is the mastermind of the problem.
4. Moral Value
Same as its soundtrack, this movie reminds us not to give up on everything, just keep trying and trying, trying everything and making something new. Life is all about problems, problems always come and leave. One problem has been solved and another problem will come to us, of course, that's a life. And for facing our problem, just ignore people say for braking our dream, just keep trying and prove that we can do for reaching our dream. And don't be afraid to fall on our journey, believe in ourselves that we can, we can, and we can.
This movie was very impressive to me when I watched in 2016, I was in senior high school. I had a dream that it was very difficult for me at that time. It made me doubt that I could reach my dream. By watching this movie, I cried and created an advice for my own, ""Believe in yourself that you can reach what you want as long as you want to try more, more and more, nothing impossible in this world."" Moreover, the plot twist reminds us for not to ease believing someone and not to judge a book by its cover.For me, this movie has almost no lack. This film is very recommended for watching by everyone, from children to adult, even elderly, because of its own picture and its value. For children who haven't been able to understand the value, they can enjoy the beautiful picture, the cute characters and moments, and of course the song.

She is put on duty as a meter maid and realizes sexism along with her species is under attack. She is feisty and eventually hooks up with a con-man fox (the least trusted species) whom she enlists to help her solve a kidnapping case. Actually, it's otter napping.

10,2016-04-07,"As someone who has been an enormous Disney fan all my life (the only films that don't do much for me are 'Chicken Little', 'Home on the Range' and 'The Black Cauldron', if it counts also 'Planes'), Zootropolis may not be as good as the best of classic Disney or the 'big four' of the Renaissance era.However, it is for me the jewel of Disney's 'second renaissance' (their return to form era starting with 'The Princess and the Frog', and if it counts -might not as it is Disney Toon Studios- their only misfire from that era is 'Planes'). Despite a couple of issues 'The Princess and the Frog' was still enormously entertaining. 'Tangled was Disney's best since 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (not sure how much of a popular opinion that is though), until the even better 'Wreck it Ralph' took that title. 'Winnie the Pooh' was immensely charming and sweet with its one problem being that it was too short. 'Frozen' despite what people say to me was the best animated film of 2013 besides 'Ernest et Celestine' (and the amount of hate it gets and the detractors' attitude towards those who loved, or even liked, the film has been blown way out of proportion). And 'Big Hero 6' was fun and touching with one of Disney's most endearing characters in recent years in Baymax.Onto the review properly for 'Zootropolis' now. The animation is fantastic with rich colours, vivid, beautifully designed and colourful backgrounds and lovingly designed characters whose movements flow fluidly and never robotically. Some of it is even very inventive and imaginative in the set pieces. Michael Giacchino's score is cleverly orchestrated, energetic and catchy, not as good as his scores for the ones for the Pixar films 'Up' and 'Inside Out' but it complements 'Zootropolis' very well indeed.'Zootropolis' has some very smart and hilarious writing, cleverly balancing sly references, witty humour and also genuine pathos and heart with few if any awkward tonal shifts. The visual gags are similarly inventive and a joy to watch. The story is so consistently well paced and involving and is told with such energy, charm and heart that some may forget the storyline being predictable. To me, it had enough originality to not make it matter that much. What was also impressive about 'Zootropolis' was how it dealt with such heavy and wholly relevant themes and issues, one of most daring along with 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' and deal with it with a light touch. Some did find the message (one that's easy to identify with) forced and heavy-handed, it wasn't an issue to me at all, to this viewer it was incorporated well and respectfully.The characters in 'Zootropolis' are interesting - all serving a point to the story- with colourful personalities, none of them felt bland, none felt shoe-horned in, none felt annoying and none felt unnecessary. Love the sassiness and charm of the protagonist, and while the twist wasn't a surprise as such the villain did serve a good threat and more interesting than the recent Disney twist villains. The voice acting is just terrific from all, especially from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. Can't go wrong with Idris Elba, JK Simmons and Maurice LaMarche either.All in all, with the one small exception of the forgettable and slightly grating main song from Shakira (which was not enough to bring the film down personally) 'Zootropolis' was a superb film, not only of Disney's post-2009 films but also one of their best post-Tarzan and towards the top end in the Disney animated film ranking. 10/10 Bethany Cox",599,en,someone enormous disney fan life film much chicken little home range black cauldron count also plane zootropolis may good best classic disney big four renaissance era however jewel disney second renaissance return form era starting princess frog count might disney toon studio misfire era plane despite couple issue princess frog still enormously entertaining tangled disney best since hunchback notre dame sure much popular opinion though even better wreck ralph took title winnie pooh immensely charming sweet one problem short frozen despite people say best animated film besides ernest et celestine amount hate get detractor attitude towards loved even liked film blown way proportion big hero fun touching one disney endearing character recent year baymax onto review properly zootropolis animation fantastic rich colour vivid beautifully designed colourful background lovingly designed character whose movement flow fluidly never robotically even inventive imaginative set piece michael giacchino score cleverly orchestrated energetic catchy good score one pixar film inside complement zootropolis well indeed zootropolis smart hilarious writing cleverly balancing sly reference witty humour also genuine pathos heart awkward tonal shift visual gag similarly inventive joy watch story consistently well paced involving told energy charm heart may forget storyline predictable enough originality make matter much also impressive zootropolis dealt heavy wholly relevant theme issue one daring along hunchback notre dame deal light touch find message one easy identify forced heavy handed issue viewer incorporated well respectfully character zootropolis interesting serving point story colourful personality none felt bland none felt shoe horned none felt annoying none felt unnecessary love sassiness charm protagonist twist surprise villain serve good threat interesting recent disney twist villain voice acting terrific especially ginnifer goodwin jason bateman go wrong idris elba jk simmons maurice lamarche either one small exception forgettable slightly grating main song shakira enough bring film personally zootropolis superb film disney post film also one best post tarzan towards top end disney animated film ranking bethany cox,2016-04,316,2.967908519988779

6,2016-04-10,"In my opinion Zootopia is one of the best children animations since Rango as it attempts to tell a competent and interesting story instead of just projecting ideas and messages with only leaving stereotypical characters and thin story arcs left.Zootopia focuses on its two main leads, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde and fleshes out their characters and why they are the way they are.Their relationship is well-realised except for one aspect that is a ""spoiler"" but it happens in so many movie's that you'll know it's coming. The twists aren't nearly as predictable then in other Disney films which is refreshing and the story overall is very investing and is able to have a message about racism without it feeling shoe-horned in. In terms of animation it is nice in it's simplicity like Judy's apartment and the way the action sequences are filmed are full of energy and are all throughout the film. Some wide- shots of the city are unexceptional but the rain forest and polar setting within the film looked excellent and water in CG animation is simply now perfected. The humour lands about 80% of the time with only some jokes being meh. The movie is clever in reflecting real-life and how the way something is in real-life can be covered in a sheen through publicity and an emphasis on that through advertisement. The film's messages are clever and well- thought out and while obviously there aren't in your face about it.The film is not flawless though. There are about 5 lulls in the story that affect the pacing, dialogue sequences between the two main leads should have been a lot snappier (which ironically enough most of them took place straight after the Sloth sequence). Towards the latter half of the film plot conveniences show up and aspects are pretty dumbed down. And lastly, the song that was shoe-horned which is extremely mediocre but awful compared to most other Disney songs made for an awkward feeling in it's badness.Overall Zootopia is a great animated children's film and a pretty good movie on it's own. It's flaws deter it quite a bit but with every scene either having humour, fantastically directed and animated action, great character development and sometimes even scares Zootopia's quite large amount of flaws are outweighed by it's consistency to entertain and just be an investing film. There are some modern animated films from the 2010s that technically are on the same level as this film but the attempt to do something different and it's succession is why I like it a little bit more but it's too heavy on slow moments and it is quite flawed so this is why I'm giving Zootopia my ""GOOD"" rating-6/10",452,en,opinion zootopia one best child animation since rango attempt tell competent interesting story instead projecting idea message leaving stereotypical character thin story arc left zootopia focus two main lead judy hopps nick wilde flesh character way relationship well realised except one aspect spoiler happens many movie know coming twist nearly predictable disney film refreshing story overall investing able message racism without feeling shoe horned term animation nice simplicity like judy apartment way action sequence filmed full energy throughout film wide shot city unexceptional rain forest polar setting within film looked excellent water cg animation simply perfected humour land time joke meh movie clever reflecting real life way something real life covered sheen publicity emphasis advertisement film message clever well thought obviously face film flawless though lull story affect pacing dialogue sequence two main lead lot snappier ironically enough took place straight sloth sequence towards latter half film plot convenience show aspect pretty dumbed lastly song shoe horned extremely mediocre awful compared disney song made awkward feeling badness overall zootopia great animated child film pretty good movie flaw deter quite bit every scene either humour fantastically directed animated action great character development sometimes even scare zootopia quite large amount flaw outweighed consistency entertain investing film modern animated film technically level film attempt something different succession like little bit heavy slow moment quite flawed giving zootopia good rating,2016-04,226,2.639884167225496

7,2016-04-23,"Zootopia is about a city in which all animals live together in organized society, and follows a rabbit who, after becoming a police officer, begins to chase after a criminal who is believed to have kidnapped multiple other animals.The plot isn't really all that unique. In actuality, it's just another crime movie, only with animals instead of humans. Now that's not to say that the animal factor is never used. There are plenty of times when the characters act like animals which helps influence parts of the movie, but it tends to be primarily used for humor. Otherwise the movie is presented in such a way where you aren't really thinking about how predictable it is, but it is still extremely predictable. There are a handful of parts in the movie, especially one part towards the end involving a conflict between two characters, that feel really forced, and don't fit in with the rest of the movie, even if the whole thing already is predictable. At least it was predictable and reasonable, but at the end there was just no reason for it.The characters are interesting enough. They have their distinct character traits, and they still feel relatable and real enough, despite being animals. They seem like they have more to them than just their specific traits, but otherwise not a whole lot to mention here.The movie is surprisingly very funny. Now I knew that this movie would be funny, of course, most comedies are, but I was surprised at how often I found myself laughing at this movie.The movie touches on a handful of bigger topics, as I'm sure you've heard, but it just touches on them. It doesn't always go too far into them, and I think that if they handled these topics a little differently that maybe I would have enjoyed it more.Overall Zootopia is good. It's very funny, lots of fun, but unfortunately struggles with being predictable and a little forced at times.

It's a very fun movie that the entire family can enjoy, with humour for all age groups to chuckle at, and a story that is straight forward, but manages to be very compelling. The plot manages to be inspiring as we watch someone fight to become something they want to be, despite the fact no one believes in her, she aims to prove them wrong, I found that very uplifting, as Disney manage to give a talking bunny human qualities.

9,2016-03-08,"To put it in the most succinct way possible, Zootopia is an absolute marvel both in scale and in execution. Disney's 55th animated film may honestly be it's best. I realize this sounds like hyperbole but I cannot lie, Zootopia may frankly be the most complete, organic, emotionally resonant, socially relevant, incredibly funny film to ever come out of Disney aka the studio that has pretty much monopolized on our entertainment.If ever there was a textbook definition of an upstart it would be Judy Hopps (Goodwin). Undaunted by the discouragement around her, Judy dreams of becoming a police officer in Zootopia, the city where predator and prey live in harmony. It's easier said than done, in fact not one of her species, nor any species smaller than a wolf, has ever made it through the Police Academy. She however finds a way and achieves her dream...only to become a meter maid. As she struggles to become an asset to the force, trouble brews in the city as predators start to disappear. Judy has a hunch concerning one of the predators and recruits the unwilling Nick Wilde (Bateman) a fox with a knack for getting into trouble.One of the first things I immediately noticed about this film coming in was the humor, which while certainly filled with corny animal jokes, is organic to the characters and the situations. There are no unnecessary and useless comic-relief characters or smug jabs meant to up the snark-factor. In-fact some of the humor is so subtle yet brilliant that it kind of washes over you. Take for example Judy's neighbors, two male bushbucks which immediately inform her they're loud and are heard sparring in their apartment. This joke will go far over the heads of children and adults alike but it's still there in the details.There's also detail in the complex relationships between the characters. Predator and prey are said to get along in Zootopia but Judy slowly realizes that that bond can easily be disrupted. Predators are a minority in the city generalized as aggressive and in the case of foxes, sneaky. There is certainly a subtext here and Disney has no problem with mirroring contemporary notions of racism and sexism and intertwining it's themes with the narrative of the story. In any other story a rabbit and a fox would be mortal enemies but in this case Judy and Nick become fast friends as they solve a convoluted crime.There are many moments I found myself rolling on the floor with laughter while simultaneously in awe at the mosaic the dream-makers at Disney have created. Any other year, a movie of this kind would have been a high-watermark of entertainment yet in the era of #blacklivesmatter and unabated police brutality, Zootopia has reached new heights. Zootopia has latched onto the zeitgeist of modern America like few movies ever have. To my recollection, only Spider-Man (2002) has achieved a similar balance between light and airy entertainment and seizing the moment to become something more. Just replace the uncertainty of post-9/11 America with the uncertainty of post- Ferguson America and you got the perfect movie for the times. One that is equal amounts of hope and optimism.I love this movie. It's beautifully rendered, smartly executed, and shockingly timely. The vocal cast is unparalleled with Goodwin and Bateman providing the best performances in an animated movie since Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter in The Incredibles (2004). Disney is world renowned for it's ability to give quality family entertainment and do so with a stunning sense of grace. Zootopia only continues that trend and does so while resonating with audiences in a manner few films dare to.

2,2016-02-27,"Well, as always, critics and people will love this movie, cause it's Disney!(which I deeply love). In reality it's because there haven't been great animated movies in a decade and people are not even noticing how much the standard level is more and more lowering(except Tangled and Toy Story 3, the others were good ideas, with cheap, bland and boring results).GRAPHICS: Once again, we have an animated movie that try to reach even more graphical perfection: the world is wonderfully detailed but its pretty clear that every character of every movie created in CG will look the same. The way they move, the eyes, the facial expressions, are so graphically realistic and at the same time done with exaggerated animated acting, that it's always like watching bad mimes who are playing a part. Rating: 9\10 for the world, 3\10 for the characters(and that's almost the maximum for CGI).CHARACTERS: The fact that Disney can't create great characters anymore is depressing. The characters are boring once again; they are just created to give the most banal and predictable comedy one can watch on a TV sit-com. That's exactly the kind of humor in animation and comedy movies by now. Or even more easy: ""Look! an hamster who moves like an hamster! funny!"". The fact that an animal has its animal characteristics is the minimum I expect from Disney animation, and even more in the aesthetic normality of the world Zootopia, not treated as a joke. Or even worse, all the pop-culture references, cause they are funny! Ratings: 4\10STORY: The story is kind of good, with a dark tone, and somewhat interesting, but again, the characters are so bland in their predictable personality that I didn't managed to care very much. The point is that, in great artists hand, this could have been a nice movie. Ratings: 6\10And then we got the today moral lesson. That's not a fault for this movie to be honest, because it seems every animated movie must have a moral. And I still don't understand why . Animated movies are an aesthetic art, just like another movie, and not an educational lesson. It's because adults are so dumb nowadays(I'm sorry, but we all know that) that think if something is not educational is not for children. I have an information for you: children are smarter than adults, and they need to be treated as such.Disney, please, don't waste too much time coming up with lessons and a movie created around it, give us some GREAT CHARACTERS AND STORIES like you used to do, and the great lessons of life would come along.FINAL RATINGS: My vote is 5 on a total scale(of all time), and a 7 in the last ten years scale; but the whole feeling of the movie (the characters, the humor, the dynamics) is always the same of every recent animated movie, so I lower it to 2(since I know everybody will give it 10\10).",489,en,well always critic people love movie cause disney deeply love reality great animated movie decade people even noticing much standard level lowering except tangled toy story others good idea cheap bland boring result graphic animated movie try reach even graphical perfection world wonderfully detailed pretty clear every character every movie created cg look way move eye facial expression graphically realistic time done exaggerated animated acting always like watching bad mime playing part rating world character almost maximum cgi character fact disney create great character anymore depressing character boring created give banal predictable comedy one watch tv sit com exactly kind humor animation comedy movie even easy look hamster move like hamster funny fact animal animal characteristic minimum expect disney animation even aesthetic normality world zootopia treated joke even worse pop culture reference cause funny rating story story kind good dark tone somewhat interesting character bland predictable personality managed care much point great artist hand could nice movie rating got today moral lesson fault movie honest seems every animated movie must moral still understand animated movie aesthetic art like another movie educational lesson adult dumb nowadays sorry know think something educational child information child smarter adult need treated disney please waste much time coming lesson movie created around give u great character story like used great lesson life would come along final rating vote total scale time last ten year scale whole feeling movie character humor dynamic always every recent animated movie lower since know everybody give,2016-02,246,2.896740242912574

7,2017-11-27,"The characters complimented each other really well, the story line had me guessing, and there is comedy and entertainment for people of all ages. I would recommend this movie, but also advise that the political undertones are pretty evident, and analogies can be drawn easily to real life. But just like most political agendas, their is a lining of hypocrisy. While they support equal treatment to all animal species, there is a clear divide between the farming citizens and those living in Zootopia. The farming citizens have ""settled hard"" and did not follow their dreams or even believe in them. They are also perceived to be behind the times, still holding prejudices against animals of other species. The city of Zootopia is perceived to be the city of acceptance , knowledge, and overall advancement of the animal kingdom. While the main protagonist learns that prejudices still exist in Zootopia, in the end the animals of Zootopia learn that prejudice is bad and have a dance party together lead by the Gazelle pop-icon voiced by Shakira. For kids, I believe the undertones will go over their head. If not, it can spark a good conversation. However, the conversation should also include how those who choose to farm and not pursue dreams that others may have are in no way better or worse either.

7,2025-09-11,"What happens when a city of anthropomorphic animals becomes the stage for a story that mixes buddy-cop comedy with deeper themes of prejudice and ambition? Zootopia succeeds in delivering a colorful animated adventure that entertains children while also engaging adults with layered storytelling.The film follows Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), an optimistic rabbit determined to prove herself as the first rabbit police officer in the bustling city of Zootopia. Partnered with the sly fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), Judy investigates a conspiracy that threatens the city's harmony. Their dynamic is the film's heart, offering humor, charm, and an evolving friendship that highlights trust and empathy.Visually, Zootopia is vibrant and inventive. Each district-ranging from the icy Tundratown to the miniature Rodentia-demonstrates Disney's attention to world-building, creating a city both imaginative and believable. The animation is complemented by sharp humor, with standout comedic sequences such as the DMV run by sloths.Yet beyond its charm, the film embeds a timely allegory about stereotypes, bias, and social division. While these themes elevate the film's resonance, at times the messaging feels heavy-handed, overshadowing the narrative subtlety. The mystery plot, though serviceable, occasionally takes second place to the broader moral lessons.Rating: 7/10 - Zootopia shines as a visually engaging and socially conscious animated feature, balancing comedy and heart, even if its themes are delivered more overtly than necessary.",223,en,happens city anthropomorphic animal becomes stage story mix buddy cop comedy deeper theme prejudice ambition zootopia succeeds delivering colorful animated adventure entertains child also engaging adult layered storytelling film follows judy hopps voiced ginnifer goodwin optimistic rabbit determined prove first rabbit police officer bustling city zootopia partnered sly fox nick wilde jason bateman judy investigates conspiracy threatens city harmony dynamic film heart offering humor charm evolving friendship highlight trust empathy visually zootopia vibrant inventive district ranging icy tundratown miniature rodentia demonstrates disney attention world building creating city imaginative believable animation complemented sharp humor standout comedic sequence dmv run sloth yet beyond charm film embeds timely allegory stereotype bias social division theme elevate film resonance time messaging feel heavy handed overshadowing narrative subtlety mystery plot though serviceable occasionally take second place broader moral lesson rating zootopia shine visually engaging socially conscious animated feature balancing comedy heart even theme delivered overtly necessary,2025-09,150,2.1912902777844665
10,2016-04-17,"Walking into the theatre, I expected to at least be entertained by Disney's 55th animated movie, after the crazy streak that is Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Big Hero 6 and Inside Out. Thank you Disney, for taking my expectations, crushing them so hard and renewing my faith that Disney is still steadily improving. (However, I am likely to be disappointed after this movie, just goes to show how much this movie elevated my expectations. It's that good, to me at least).Why do I like this movie so much? That is because within its entertaining buddy cop facade, it shows a lot more and has a lot of relevant messages to tell. It unfolds at an engaging pace and will manage to surprise viewers.Protagonist Judy Hopps (voiced by the bubbly Ginnifer Goodwin) has big dreams and wants to prove the world wrong - that a tiny bunny can take on the big mammal job of a police officer. This is certainly something that connects well with the audience. She wants to break the small-animals-can't-do-tough-mammal-job stereotype. Ironically, she is eventually roped into a battle with her own subconscious stereotypes of others. Meanwhile, you have the flip side in Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman, who has no problem playing an animated version of himself), who succumbs to his stereotype. What seemed to be a message that ""you can be anything"" slowly turns into a (surprisingly) timely lesson on tolerance in diversity, discrimination and racial politics.The two lead characters Judy and Nick, have great chemistry and you'll find yourself rooting for them throughout (some even want more chemistry *ahem*. A lot more). Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Elba) and Ben Clawhauser (voiced by Nate Torrence) were nice additions to the cast, though the lack of focus on them is understandable. J.K. Simmons and Jenny Slate also lends their unique voices to Mayor Lionheart and Asst Mayor Bellweather, both of which are remarkably well-suited.To make it more fun, the movie is also riddled with references (both in pop culture and biological), hidden jokes and easter eggs. However, adults will probably have a lot more fun with these as they cater to the older audiences, like with the Godfather reference.Last but not least, the animation is beautiful. Everything, from characters to architecture to effects, looks spot on.All in all, this movie was awesome. It is guaranteed fun for the whole family (though kids might be a little scared at certain points). I enjoyed it thoroughly (maybe even felt close to crying) and I certainly would like to see more, sequels or series, just please keep the voice actors.

7,2019-12-03,"This Disney movie interested me when I first saw the previews way back when, but never got around to seeing it. Then I got my wife Disney+ as a Christmas gift and saw that it was on their streaming service so we gave it a watch. It was cute and mildly amusing; however, I found that it could have been a bit more funny as the crime began to overshadow the humor a bit in this one. What I mean is, figuring out what was causing the animals to go mad was the more interesting portion of the film rather than the fact we have a bunny cop and wise cracking fox trying to figure it out.The story has a bunny whose dream it is, to be a cop in Zootopia. She ends up becoming the first bunny police officer and she is basically given the job of meter maid, much to the delight of her parents who are scared to death for their little girl. She soon though gets wrapped up in a case involving a missing otter and must enlist the help of a con artist fox to find out where the missing otter is.The movie is more funny during the first part than the last third. The voice acting is good as was the animation. The areas of Zootopia really popped as you had snowy zones and a rain forest. The best part of the film, though, to me was the sloth run DMV which so accurately depicts how it is inside the real department of motor vehicles! I also like the mob boss who was really into icing people!So, in the end, this Disney film was pretty good. It is nice to have a Disney animation that does not have songs and such within like the police chief alluded to. The film seems to have been a very huge success so I am sure the inevitable sequel will be coming, but unlike some films, this one warrants one as you can have many misadventures for two officers on the job!",344,en,disney movie interested first saw preview way back never got around seeing got wife disney christmas gift saw streaming service gave watch cute mildly amusing however found could bit funny crime began overshadow humor bit one mean figuring causing animal go mad interesting portion film rather fact bunny cop wise cracking fox trying figure story bunny whose dream cop zootopia end becoming first bunny police officer basically given job meter maid much delight parent scared death little girl soon though get wrapped case involving missing otter must enlist help con artist fox find missing otter movie funny first part last third voice acting good animation area zootopia really popped snowy zone rain forest best part film though sloth run dmv accurately depicts inside real department motor vehicle also like mob bos really icing people end disney film pretty good nice disney animation song within like police chief alluded film seems huge success sure inevitable sequel coming unlike film one warrant one many misadventure two officer job,2019-12,166,2.343881594635286
10,2016-03-04,"You owe it to yourself to see Disney's new animated film Zootopia, a film so timely and relevant it's almost startling. You owe it to yourself to seek it out in a time in America where craziness, hatefulness, and fear is being further instilled in the general public by the very same people who should be fighting against it; the very same people who should be forcing us, as a collective, to rise above simple-minded assertions and mass generalizations about the people around us. You owe it to yourself to see this film simply because it's a brand new Disney classic.The film takes place in the vibrant, diverse world of Zootopia, a place where predators and prey live together in harmony, and are free to be whoever and whatever they want to be. These reasons are precisely why the land attracts Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a small bunny with dreams of being a police officer. Living on a farm, her parents fear this because, not only has a bunny never become a police officer, but they feel Judy should confine her aspirations to selling carrots on the family farm, something Judy has no interest in doing. After successfully completing police training, Judy is thrust into the force alongside other, more muscled animals such as rhinoceroses, rams, bulls, and elephants. Oh my.Judy's boss, Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo, forces her to be a ""metermaid"" while the other animals take on the bigger crimes, specifically a case involving fourteen missing predators. Judy tries to show herself by issuing over two-hundred citations in just a couple of hours, but to no avail, as Chief Bogo wants to make sure she knows her place on the Zootopia police force. When Judy winds up catching a weasel after robbing a store, she is just about to be fired when Chief Bogo tasks her with finding a local otter who has been missing for over a week. If she can find the otter in forty-eight hours or less, she can keep her job, but if she doesn't, she'll be forced to resign. Judy enlists in the help of Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a fox, one of the most looked-down-upon predators in Zootopia, who has been doing number of odd jobs since he was young, after blackmailing him in order to get him to cooperate. Together, the two work to find the otter, but in turn, discover something bigger. Oh my.Zootopia wears its intentions on its sleeves, but not in a way that distracts or simplifies its core themes. As you can probably tell, this is a film about both racism and sexism, two features of society that, while probably never going away so long as humans roam the Earth, do not have to be such amplified forces of hate. Screenwriters Jared Bush and Paul Johnston carefully construct a world, predicated upon a particular dream, and within that world, populate it with a variety of characters, some labeled as normative, others quietly labeled as the enemy that many are waiting to step out of line. It doesn't take a scholar to see that rabbits represent women in society, while predators represent minorities.It does, however, take considerable screen writing talent to create a film that can be enjoyed and understood by both children and adults on a fairly similar level. Even Pixar's Inside Out was a film that sort of teetered a bit more to the adult crowd, with its lofty morals about children coping with their emotions, despite the fact that kids of all ages could at least enjoy the film as surface-level entertainment. Bush and Johnston pen Zootopia carefully, but bluntly, to the point where you can't ignore its profound, but simple message of inclusion and acceptance of peers. Oh my.Countless animated films have made themselves about preaching the gospel of acceptance and loving thy neighbor, but few have done it with the kind of thematic relevance, consistent wit, and zealous energy as Zootopia. Rather than sticking too a cleverly storyboarded, intricate plot, Bush and Johnston also have no problem playing around, allowing both Judy and Nick to free-roam in a sandbox full of original characters and allowing conversational/situational humor to prevail. This is why we get uproariously funny sequences involving three-toed sloths at the DMV, in addition to immensely creative, blink-and-you-miss-it chase sequences between a rabbit and a weasel. The film is not short on ideas nor energy, and the remarkable thing is how the film can go almost one-hundred miles an hour in every department and not even come close to running out of gas by the end credits.Zootopia is a contemporary Disney classic and should be treated as such; it will certainly give Pixar's questionable Finding Dory a run for its money in quality, awards, and overall relevance when it comes out this summer. This is a film that finds a way to be both sweet and simple, yet so urgent and topical, with an A-list voice cast, that you feel it's a soft rallying cry for unity, which is all the more reason why you shouldn't ignore it.Voiced by: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K.

9,2016-05-05,"Because in terms of the setting, it's kind of like that, but good.Disney's latest CGI feature outing is beginning to make me question whether or not Deadpool is going to be the best movie I watch all year, as Zootopia is giving it a pretty good run for its money. While watching this, I was struck by all of the things it tries to do differently. Despite the fact that there are predators and prey coexisting, it feels no need to paint one side as better or worse than the other. In fact, it tries to teach that in societies with an ""us"" and ""them"" concept, that there are good and bad individuals in both groups. Among other lessons it tries to convey are that things are done for reasons other than the obvious, authority and social roles should be challenged when the need arises, respect should be earned rather than blindly given... I could go on for a while, but I'd get pretty boring and preachy.So instead, I'll leave behind my after-school special bit and explain what else works. This movie certainly knows how to reference pop culture, in that the reference is innocuous at worst for those who don't get the reference and still manages to work in context without joke behind it (as opposed to loudly declaring ""Hey, this thing exists! Now those of you who know the thing, laugh in recognition!""). The characters are also very enjoyable, my personal favourite being Nick Wilde. He's slick without being oily, clever and quick with a pun, but not mean-spirited. In fact, out of the entire cast, he's probably the most level-headed and least presumptuous. Judy is also a great example of an underdog (or should I say underbunny?) who defies the odds and social norms to achieve her dreams, but she's also prone to fallacies and misconceptions, making her likable yet flawed without either feeling forced.However, there are some things about the movie that bug me a little. Why is it that only the mammals evolved to become how they are today? What about the birds, the fish and the reptiles? Why does the movie go so far to build Zootopia as a place with so many different zones, but only visit a few? And finally, why does it have the hardheaded police chief cliché? If Judy and Nick hadn't pressed him to listen to reason so hard, the movie would have had a much more grim ending. I just wish that there could be a police chief character who had more awareness than a sack of wet concrete.All in all, though, Zootopia is a great movie that's worth a watch because of its top-notch story, solid characters, superb soundtrack, and thought-provoking messages.

And yes, somehow it really works. This movie is so smart and creative as it addresses issues such as diversity and gender stereotypes in such an engaging way. So many animations these days are purely just dumb moments that will keep a child quiet for 90 minutes. Although Zootopia is equally engaging for both adults and children due to how well written it is. Something that is over looked is just how incredibly hard it is to write a great screenplay for an animation.

4,2016-03-20,"Bright, bubbly, breakneck: all defining characteristics of Disney's latest animated adventure. Sanctimonious, serious, seldom funny: other key traits that suffocate this family film until there's very little left to enjoy. With multiple ecosystems and a plethora of cultural subsets – mirroring our own society wouldn't you know – the anthropomorphic animal-world is conceptually interesting and beautifully animated, but the story told within this universe is disappointingly dull. The simple predators-and-prey-living-together plot device should've been ripe for subtle metaphors amongst zippy action and constant laughs, yet the film's themes – breaking down stereotypes, looking past race, being inclusive – are hammered home so heavy-handedly it feels like you're getting in trouble. A major issue is the lack of humour (or more accurately: successful humour) which, save for a truly hilarious sloth-centred sequence that had me in tears, is woefully misjudged and/or drowned out by the persistence of shoving a point down our throat. The muddled tone makes for a confusing viewing too; the unapologetic innocent nature of proceedings suggests this is aimed squarely at the toddler demographic, yet the Godfather and 'Breaking Bad' references are directly at odds with this. The infectiously optimistic bunny at the movie's heart, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), is a sweet and likable protagonist, however the mischievous fox who partners with Hopps, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), has more depth and charisma.

10,2016-03-06,"Some movies perfectly personifies the past (Saving Private Ryan), some movies predict the future (Fight Club), and some (like this one) perfectly nail the current issues so accurately you feel like they financed, wrote, and filmed the movie yesterday. Read the following sentence slowly because you might not believe it the first time you glance through it: Zootopia is the best film under the Walt Disney Animation Studios banner since Emperor's New Groove, and is arguably the most important animated film since Princess and the Frog. Yes, the clock has to reach back 16 years before you can find a Disney Studios animated film as strong as this one. Between the layers of intense subject matter and a surprisingly strong mystery plot lies a beautiful message for the kids and tweens that needs to be heard, especially today.Nothing on the surface can actually prepare you for what happens once you enter the setting of Zootopia. However, the surface is quite delightful to look at. The animation is spectacularly detailed and contributes mightily to the storyline about animals living together. The main city itself branches off into several subdivisions, each with its own distinctive personality. Unlike most Disney films, Zootopia itself is so massive its practically begging for continuations through film and television. It's an expansive visual feast of colors and colorful characters, similar to the creative world of Wreck-It Ralph. However, once the movie gets going you will quickly realize that although it is a children's movie, there is plenty for teenagers and even adults to laugh at and to be moved by. The mystery is slightly more mature than what is expected, and we even reach quite dark territory once the second half kicks into play. This is a children's movie, but has an incredible script full of heart, soul, drama, and necessary comedy to offset the bleakness. Using Pixar's collective creativity technique (which has been rusting lately), we have three directors and nearly a dozen writing credits attached (two wrote the screenplay, many others contributed to the story). It is a miracle that so many contributors to a single script made a film that flowed so well.Disney and Pixar are the best at coming up with the required vocal talents to bring the animated films to life, and this is no exception. Jennifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are absolutely perfect for each other and play to their strengths: Goodwin with her charming all-American bubbliness and Bateman's sly hustling ways. They dominate the film but luckily you'll learn to love them immediately through their strengths and their flaws. And in keeping with recent tradition, you won't know who the true villain is until later as the stakes start getting higher.Rich Moore (most experienced of the three-director team) should be a bigger name because his directing credits includes the early 90s Simpsons and some of Futurama's greatest episodes. What those shows and this film has in common is the electric mix of well-paced story, strong characters, and shades of drama and commentary that speaks to the current issues. Zootopia explores racism, sexism, classism, and diversity fears better than any of the trailblazing Disney animated films before it. That being said, it's not a knock on Princess and the Frog, Mulan, or Hunchback of Notre Dame---the truth is Zootopia would have never been fully greenlit by Disney in the 90s, and perhaps even the 2000s.Disney has gotten gutsier and ballsier in recent years with the Too Big to Fail attitude; and although the company definitely remains officially mum on the current political turmoil, Zootopia can and should be its resume and cover letter concerning what side of the fight they are on. Zootopia is a daring animated film that will frighten you (especially the youngsters), will emotionally hurt you, and will leave you thinking long after Shakira's gazelle character lets out her final note. It's the perfect concoction of mystery, comedy, action, and social commentary that not only allows it to become an early entry for Best Animated Feature, but (dare I say it), a Best Picture nomination.Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between is essentially flawless. It has something for everyone, although the youngest ones will struggle as it gets darker. Through its importance as well as the engaging, ever-revolving plot, I give this film the highest marks. Zootopia will stand as one of the best in all of 2016, and among the best works of animation this entire decade.

6,2016-04-09,"Remember the Academy Award winning film Crash and how everyone thought it was the worst Best Picture winner of all time? How everyone hated it because it was very one sided on its views on racism and how even though it was against stereotypes it itself was stereotypical? That's how I feel with Zootopia, which has a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, but not to the extent of Crash. While Zootopia has good cast and a fun feel it suffers from a bland story, ho-hum characters, and a very uninteresting take on racism. Nothing in the film really ever makes it stand out from other Disney film. If it didn't talk about racism then no one would be singing it's praises.Zootopia starts out with an unnecessary backstory right at the beginning about how the world works in a play that the main character, Judy Hopps, is in. Zootopia is the city in the universe of this film where Predator and Prey live together in harmony. Judy Hopps is the first rabbit to join the police force and is trying to solve a recent case where Predators are being kidnapped. With the help of a red fox con artist, Nick Wilde, they uncover a conspiracy that'll shake the people of Zootopia. Too bad I wasn't shaking because I didn't really care for the characters or the story of Zootopia. I'm not trying to be harsh but I can't hide the fact that I don't get easily invested in stories that are beat to beat generic stories. If you have ever seen a detective film then you have basically seen Zootopia. It does nothing new with what's given and feels like Crash with animals.I hear that many people love how the film talked about racism but it didn't get extremely in depth with it. Just because you talk about prejudice doesn't make your film amazing. When Zootopia talks about racial prejudice it never bring up anything interesting or new. It just says ""racism is bad"". Agreeing with a certain political or social issue doesn't mean the film is great. I liked Blue is the Warmest Color but I would still give it a 7/10. Just talking about social issues isn't enough to make your film one of the highest rated films of the year. A movie that talked about racism perfectly is Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. It said that racism is a complicated subject matter and that some people say something is racist just to get their racism out on others. It never agrees with one side and lets you decide what is right. Zootopia never goes deep into these issues as much as it should to make an interesting story.The best part of Zootopia the cast by far. Ginnifer Goodwin has always been a good actress and she brings a lot of enthusiasm to the character of Judy Hopps. Same goes for Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde. I absolutely loved his character at many parts of the film and gave me a smile each time I saw him on screen. The other great actors in the film are sadly wasted, J.K. Simmons is an actor that I have appreciated ever since Spider-Man and I started following more of him after his Oscar- winning role in Whiplash, so I am always extremely disappointed whenever any film wastes him like in the tragic Terminator Genisys. Idris Elba plays a very generic chief but it never goes anywhere new or fun. I personally would have loved to see Elba have more fun and do more stereotypical Chief moments in Zootopia. But there isn't a terrible performance in this film. Disney never disappoints when it comes to voice acting and Zootopia is no exception.Zootopia, while disappointing, is still a fun film that Disney fans will definitely get a kick out of. While it would be great to see Disney tread off the seemingly long and winding generic road they are able to squeeze as much magic in their films as possible. If they do ever make a sequel or decide to talk about other social issues in future films hopefully they can do something risky that will truly make the film exceptional. Maybe not the go to movie to see this year but definitely something to check out.",714,en,remember academy award winning film crash everyone thought worst best picture winner time everyone hated one sided view racism even though stereotype stereotypical feel zootopia rotten tomato extent crash zootopia good cast fun feel suffers bland story ho hum character uninteresting take racism nothing film really ever make stand disney film talk racism one would singing praise zootopia start unnecessary backstory right beginning world work play main character judy hopps zootopia city universe film predator prey live together harmony judy hopps first rabbit join police force trying solve recent case predator kidnapped help red fox con artist nick wilde uncover conspiracy shake people zootopia bad shaking really care character story zootopia trying harsh hide fact get easily invested story beat beat generic story ever seen detective film basically seen zootopia nothing new given feel like crash animal hear many people love film talked racism get extremely depth talk prejudice make film amazing zootopia talk racial prejudice never bring anything interesting new say racism bad agreeing certain political social issue mean film great liked blue warmest color would still give talking social issue enough make film one highest rated film year movie talked racism perfectly spike lee right thing said racism complicated subject matter people say something racist get racism others never agrees one side let decide right zootopia never go deep issue much make interesting story best part zootopia cast far ginnifer goodwin always good actress brings lot enthusiasm character judy hopps go jason bateman nick wilde absolutely loved character many part film gave smile time saw screen great actor film sadly wasted j k simmons actor appreciated ever since spider man started following oscar winning role whiplash always extremely disappointed whenever film waste like tragic terminator genisys idris elba play generic chief never go anywhere new fun personally would loved see elba fun stereotypical chief moment zootopia terrible performance film disney never disappoints come voice acting zootopia exception zootopia disappointing still fun film disney fan definitely get kick would great see disney tread seemingly long winding generic road able squeeze much magic film possible ever make sequel decide talk social issue future film hopefully something risky truly make film exceptional maybe go movie see year definitely something check,2016-04,369,2.927561858919223
6,2016-12-22,"Zootopia is a movie that knows how to keep you engaged from start to finish. Something happens all the time, the characters are funny, the setting is creative, something is always moving to attract your attention, nothing overstay its welcome until something else happens to replace it. I wasn't bored for a single second while watching it. And that's all the good things I have to say about it, for everything else is one big mess.Starting with the fabled racism topic where herbivores are afraid of carnivores and discriminate them. That's not racism you guys, racism is something that applies to races of the same species, not throughout different ones. When a man considers himself superior to a fruit fly, that is not racism.Even if we are to assume all animals in the move are supposed to be the same species and just happens to look completely different, and eat completely different things, it's still not working out because we are never given an explanation to why the ecosystem hasn't been messed up beyond repair.For example there is the joke about bunnies multiplying extremely fast. If carnivores are no longer a threat why isn't overpopulation an issue? And yes, it's a joke, it's not supposed to be taken seriously. The same can be said about the whole theme. It's not really explored, it's just tongue in check and a lazy excuse for a conflict.Then it's plot which, holy smokes, is it riddled with plot convenience or what? Every single event the heroine takes part in just happens to be part of the same conspiracy and working to her benefit. When things get really grim she just happens to have an epiphany. Also that carrot recorder is panacea. There is nothing you can't fix by secretly recording someone against his knowledge. Which by the way it's illegal to use without a warrant and can't be used in court. Also, they can easily sue you for invasion of privacy. But what do I know, this movie is supposed to be smart.And then there is also the issue of the furries, which is there to attract people with very peculiar preferences. Calling this a movie for kids, so I should not be very critical, is lying to yourselves. Just because it has cute talking animals does not mean it's childish, for it's full of pop references and sexual fetishes.As a whole, I had a blast watching it. If I were to score it on enjoyment alone, I would have given it a perfect score. But I am not a pleb, so I won't. The script is lazy, the themes are not really explored, and since I am not a furry, I was a bit creeped out by the bestiality innuendoes.

1,2016-06-21,"This movie is often seen as being an excellent action-humor combo containing a great moral component. I will briefly try to explain while it is neither of those things.First, I'll start by admitting that the humor present in the movie can work if you put yourself in a certain mood. It is combined with a great visual production aiming at putting you in that exact light-hearted mood, which works fine. The problem is largely the plot: it is uninspired (recycled) and things seems to happen as if they came from a magician's hat. Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the random/surprising elements where entertaining. The problem is that, while it somehow works in the beginning, where the evolution of the plot make us discover Zootopia, the story becomes quickly bland an uninteresting as the movie enter an action phase.As for the interesting moral components this movie is credited for, they are inexistent. The whole lesson of the whole thing appears to be that you shouldn't listen to your prejudices, and you should be accepting of everybody. We could also add the classical: you can be anything you want if only you would try hard enough. I would start by saying that these ""lessons"" are so obvious and in-your-face that they cannot have any effect on children. They are what the movie SAYS, but in fact the movie DOES something very different. What it does is to make a link between a character's specie and his personality (in direct contradiction with the lesson about prejudice and promoting inclusion). It also treat most supporting character as pure stereotypes based on specie, which reduce their humanity in the eye of the viewer while using it as joke material. So what the movie in fact does is to tell you that large chunk of population have very few value, while those who deserve respect are the ones who ""work hard"" to obtain and maintain power over others, be it by wise manipulation or socially recognized opportunity to exert physical domination of others (police). This also implies that those who the film laugh at are deserving of their situation, as they didn't work hard enough to raise above the masses.In short, this movie is a montage of jokes with a plot to support those jokes, which tries to compensate for its lack of substance with ""lessons"" that are nothing more than virtue-signaling.",399,en,movie often seen excellent action humor combo containing great moral component briefly try explain neither thing first start admitting humor present movie work put certain mood combined great visual production aiming putting exact light hearted mood work fine problem largely plot uninspired recycled thing seems happen came magician hat course problem random surprising element entertaining problem somehow work beginning evolution plot make u discover zootopia story becomes quickly bland uninteresting movie enter action phase interesting moral component movie credited inexistent whole lesson whole thing appears listen prejudice accepting everybody could also add classical anything want would try hard enough would start saying lesson obvious face cannot effect child movie say fact movie something different make link character specie personality direct contradiction lesson prejudice promoting inclusion also treat supporting character pure stereotype based specie reduce humanity eye viewer using joke material movie fact tell large chunk population value deserve respect one work hard obtain maintain power others wise manipulation socially recognized opportunity exert physical domination others police also implies film laugh deserving situation work hard enough raise mass short movie montage joke plot support joke try compensate lack substance lesson nothing virtue signaling,2016-06,192,2.7400872063664488

Not only was the trailer hilarious (that sloth scene slayed me) but I am a huge fan of animated films, and this one in particular had plenty of positive buzz around it.Zootopia is a film that goes beyond a child's world of talking animals and deals with some pretty heavy themes, including failure, bullying and prejudices against those who are different (in this case, it's the predators who are the unlikely victims).Judy Hopps (voiced by the adorable Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny with a big dream. Much to the rest of the animal world's amusement, she vows to move away from the humble carrot farm she's inherited from her parents to become a police officer in the big, bad city. She spends the rest of the film trying to prove what she's capable of to everyone she meets, particularly when she teams up with the misfit rascal fox named Nick Wilde (where a deliciously sarcastic Jason Bateman lends his voice).Not only is the animation phenomenal, my kudos also goes to the screenwriters who have created a magical world of evolved creatures that actually don't extend too far from our current reality, making this film very humorous, heartfelt and relatable.

But she's a bunny, what the heck can a bunny do as a crime? It's a stereotype the resonates so strongly with the audience, with anyone who was thought of as being too weak to do what the ""big boys"" do. Judy is breaking those barriers, breaking those stereotypes to show that even though she may be tiny, she can do their job twice as good as they can. And boy, does she do it. She is suck a great character and the film has so much heart to it because of who she is and how she develops in the film. She's so single minded on her quest to do something right, to prove herself, that she becomes lost within the prejudices that now surpass the. It's a growing moment for her and the audience because they see her mistakes and they see her fix them.As for Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman), he faces many of the same challenges as Judy, but his are based more on the prejudices of a fox. He's a predator, and no one gives him the chance to be anything more than that, so he stopped trying. This is something everyone faced in their life, bullies to geeks, jocks and cheerleaders; society has a way of bunching the few alongside with the few bad apples. Nick represents that side of society that many people don't realize is even there because it is just part of how culture tends to work. And the fact that this film is addressing that makes is such a profound film.This movie should be applauded on the story itself, because these writers and the directors, together they were able to create this very time- appropriate story that has a very powerful theme to it. It is simply such an amazing story about inclusion that doesn't play nice. This is may a kids movie, but that did not stop the writers from adding in some very dramatic scenes to highlight the negativity that comes from watching life through stereotypes and prejudices, how dangerous and hurtful they can be to an individual. It's all about not to judge the book by its cover.Story and amazing voice acting aside, A movie filled with heart, laughs, and plenty of teaching moments for a better society is amazing, and to make it even more amazing were the graphics of the film. Animated movies just get better and better, and Disney works amazingly with their graphics putting so much work into it, they deserve the recognition for their hard work. Everyone deserves something for this film because all together, this film was just an amazing piece of animation that had such a strong story. This is the perfect family film and is the perfect film for everyone of any age, gender, or race because of what it teaches: inclusion.",591,en,great family film everyone need watch teaching moment within film let phrase entire movie teaching moment zootopia film inclusion putting away stereotype prejudice aside live better society negative much blind someone see something hatred anger story amazing follows judy hopps voiced ginnifer goodwin small town bunny want part big league officer large big animal work together solve crime big city bunny heck bunny crime stereotype resonates strongly audience anyone thought weak big boy judy breaking barrier breaking stereotype show even though may tiny job twice good boy suck great character film much heart develops film single minded quest something right prove becomes lost within prejudice surpass growing moment audience see mistake see fix nick voiced jason bateman face many challenge judy based prejudice fox predator one give chance anything stopped trying something everyone faced life bully geek jock cheerleader society way bunching alongside bad apple nick represents side society many people realize even part culture tends work fact film addressing make profound film movie applauded story writer director together able create time appropriate story powerful theme simply amazing story inclusion play nice may kid movie stop writer adding dramatic scene highlight negativity come watching life stereotype prejudice dangerous hurtful individual judge book cover story amazing voice acting aside movie filled heart laugh plenty teaching moment better society amazing make even amazing graphic film animated movie get better better disney work amazingly graphic putting much work deserve recognition hard work everyone deserves something film together film amazing piece animation strong story perfect family film perfect film everyone age gender race teach inclusion,2016-05,261,2.667576779711373
6,2016-06-27,"We were prey and predators once, antagonizing each other. But it was thousands of years ago, now we're all evolved, peaceful and equal. And if anything falls out of that paradigm then it's definitely a result of some malicious interference.That's basically the message of Zootopia. Calling it utopian is hardly insightful, but there's no better way to describe it. An upbeat and positive story of a little bunny who wanted to be different and to change the world by making it a kingdom of kindness and equality once again - that doesn't seem remotely realistic, even if the story was not about animals but humans. Still, with nice visuals and enough goofing around, it's exactly what would keep kids captivated for enough time so that their parents could get their much-needed precious rest. By being somewhere else or doing something else.And I mean it. Zootopia may be full of surprises for the young generation, but it's not a film that can provide a second layer an adult viewer could enjoy. There's no subtlety, instead, everything is explicit and for show, so any attempt to demonstrate some character development is somewhat staged. The difficulties are temporary and solve themselves without much labor. So, at the end of the day, even rooting for the happy ending is not too engaging because it never really seems that it could happen any other way.It's hard to blame Disney for a lack of the real-world complexity. After all, it's what they do: flicks for kids. And those flicks are more or less fairy tales where the good wins simply because they want us to believe in goodness and uphold it. However, there's a thin line between teaching the good and claiming that it's the natural way for everyone, which could be corrupted but is still something we all perceive equally. And while the fairy-tale thinking, despite being obviously naive, bears no big harm, the white lies of the latter approach create a much more distorting illusion. An illusion that we're all the same inside and that we all want to be the same.Come think of it, there might even be a second layer in Zootopia. Unfortunately, that layer looks like some sort of leftist propaganda, telling us that whoever we are, we have no other destiny but to stay united. That no matter who you are, a predator or a prey, a Muslim or an atheist, a Syrian refugee or a German burgher, living together is something that all of you must want and love. And if you wanna separate and set your own order of things, even if you're a vast majority, then there's something wrong with you and you're definitely a bad guy. No dude, stay put and love your neighbors, even if they bang at your wall and yell all night. And don't you dare expecting them to apologize for it!For more than half a century the real-world us were being told that there's no other way, and those who disagree should be branded fascists. So it's quite symbolic that I got to watch Zootopia just a few days after the British people showed the world that an alternative is possible. So nice try Disney, but sometimes it's better to ask difficult questions rather than to make up overly simple answers. And a word of advice to the audience: if you so desperately want a Disney's fairy tale about the world's issues, watch Tomorrowland instead. It's equally simplistic, but at least it leaves you the freedom of choice without stamping the moral labels on it.",593,en,prey predator antagonizing thousand year ago evolved peaceful equal anything fall paradigm definitely result malicious interference basically message zootopia calling utopian hardly insightful better way describe upbeat positive story little bunny wanted different change world making kingdom kindness equality seem remotely realistic even story animal human still nice visuals enough goofing around exactly would keep kid captivated enough time parent could get much needed precious rest somewhere else something else mean zootopia may full surprise young generation film provide second layer adult viewer could enjoy subtlety instead everything explicit show attempt demonstrate character development somewhat staged difficulty temporary solve without much labor end day even rooting happy ending engaging never really seems could happen way hard blame disney lack real world complexity flick kid flick less fairy tale good win simply want u believe goodness uphold however thin line teaching good claiming natural way everyone could corrupted still something perceive equally fairy tale thinking despite obviously naive bear big harm white lie latter approach create much distorting illusion illusion inside want come think might even second layer zootopia unfortunately layer look like sort leftist propaganda telling u whoever destiny stay united matter predator prey muslim atheist syrian refugee german burgher living together something must want love wanna separate set order thing even vast majority something wrong definitely bad guy dude stay put love neighbor even bang wall yell night dare expecting apologize half century real world u told way disagree branded fascist quite symbolic got watch zootopia day british people showed world alternative possible nice try disney sometimes better ask difficult question rather make overly simple answer word advice audience desperately want disney fairy tale world issue watch tomorrowland instead equally simplistic least leaf freedom choice without stamping moral label,2016-06,290,2.787379567599713

9,2016-03-22,"'ZOOTOPIA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The 55th feature film from Walt Disney Animation Studios. This one revolves around a world of anthropomorphic animals; where a cop bunny teams with a con artist fox, to solve a missing animal case. It was directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore, and co-directed by Jared Bush (the trio also co-wrote the movie, with 5 other writers). The film stars the voice talents of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Octavia Spencer and Tommy Chong. It's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and I have to agree; it's one of the best films of the year (so far)!Judy Hopps (Goodwin) had always dreamed of becoming the first rabbit police officer (since childhood). When her dreams finally come true, she's assigned to work at the Zootopia police department. Zootopia is a large metropolis; of all kinds of different mammals. Judy is (of course) initially met with a lot of skepticism (and prejudice). She tries to prove herself, by solving a missing otter case. She teams up with a clever con artist fox, named Nick Wilde (Bateman), in order to do so.The film is beautifully animated, and full of colorful (likable) characters. It's both funny and surprisingly touching; but what's most beautiful about the movie, is it's insightful message about bigotry. You can never judge anyone by their appearance, or social background, and what better way to illustrate that message to kids; than with a world full of various types of animals. I love this movie, because of that message (it's one that means a lot to me), and I don't usually love Disney animated films.

9,2016-02-17,"Disney has been on a winning streak lately, releasing great animated movies like Wreck-it Ralph, Frozen and Big Hero 6. The studio manages to add another gem to its line-up with Zootopia: a great film that tells a heartfelt story, while intelligently covering some delicate themes.The film follows the endeavors of Judy Hopps, a rabbit who wants to be a police officer in a world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. The twist is that all animals are sized like they are in the real world. Being a small rabbit, Judy is often confronted with difficulties while trying to fulfill her dream, but she never gives up. After graduating at the top of her class, she ends up in the metropolis of Zootopia, where she is tasked with parking duty. Of course, Judy is not satisfied with this trivial activity. Thanks to her determination she manages to get assigned to a disappearance case. Since she does not get any help from the police force, she ends up trying to crack the case with a wayward fox named Nick.The story unfolds itself to be a heartfelt journey through some visually stunning environments. Zootopia is divided into several districts, including a desert, a rain forest and a snowy suburb. This ensures the movie never looks boring, as Judy and Nick travel through different parts of the city to solve their case. A lot of time was put into developing the city and all its details. The rain forest district, for example, stays humid thanks to an abundance of sprayers, ensuring the inhabitants feel right at home.While going through their journey, both Judy and Nick learn a lot about themselves and the world around them. Their characters are very well developed and undergo a logical and heartfelt evolution. This is where the movie really shines in my opinion, as it touches on some very delicate issues such as race and discrimination. It avoids being too preachy, but at the same time raises some really interesting questions, both for children and adults alike. These questions are all the more interesting when considering the recent racial tensions in the US and the refugee crisis in Europe. I had some very interesting conversations after the movie ended.Of course, there is also room for humor. There are a lot of puns and predictable funny moments alluding to animal stereotypes. The jokes are very well worked out though and they never feel cheesy.Overall, this is probably my favorite animated Disney movie since the Disney Revival started more then five years ago.

Sure, children may possibly learn appropriate lessons. However, they may also become confused by the same token. I actually really enjoyed the show.

I much prefer history – true or feigned– with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse applicability with allegory, but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.""J.R.R. Tolkien would have cordially disliked this movie, to put it mildly. This is an extremely preachy movie, which attempts to distill the racial issues of the USA down into black and white. Two takeaways from this movie:It is perfectly okay for black people to refer to one another as the n-word (IMDB says that is a prohibited word), just as long as non-black people do not:Clawhauser: ""O. M. Goodness, they really did hire a bunny. Ho-whop! I gotta tell you, you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.""Judy Hopps: ""Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny 'cute', but when other animals do it, that's a little...""What a terrible analogy, as ""cute"" is not a disgusting, reviled word. No one should be calling anyone the n-word, but that's not the point the movie makes. It is telling us that as long as you are the same race as someone else, you can treat that person as horribly as you like. Just as long as people of differing races are nice to one another the world will become a utopia.The second takeaway of the movie is that non-blacks are responsible for all the ills and suffering of black people. Somehow someone white is seeding all the discontent and suffering that black people experience. They are manipulating black people into being ""savages"" (to use the exact term from the movie).The problem with this totally binary view of the issues of racism and inequality in the USA is that it is inaccurate. It absolves the minority of any responsibility whatsoever. It says that they can maintain the status quo, continue calling one another the n-word, continue murdering one another (93% of murdered black people are killed by another black person), and all of that is perfectly fine. What the movie teaches is that under no circumstances may a non-black use the n-word, rub a black person's hair, or manipulate black people into killing non-black people.While Disney is to be commended for at least attempting to address the subject (and this alone is the cause célèbre prompting many reviewers to trip over themselves to gush about this film), they should at least address it in an evenhanded, responsible fashion.",441,en,cordially dislike allegory manifestation always done since grew old wary enough detect presence much prefer history true feigned varied applicability thought experience reader think many confuse applicability allegory one resides freedom reader purposed domination author j r r tolkien would cordially disliked movie put mildly extremely preachy movie attempt distill racial issue usa black white two takeaway movie perfectly okay black people refer one another n word imdb say prohibited word long non black people clawhauser goodness really hire bunny ho whop gotta tell even cuter thought judy hopps ooh ah probably know bunny call another bunny cute animal little terrible analogy cute disgusting reviled word one calling anyone n word point movie make telling u long race someone else treat person horribly like long people differing race nice one another world become utopia second takeaway movie non black responsible ill suffering black people somehow someone white seeding discontent suffering black people experience manipulating black people savage use exact term movie problem totally binary view issue racism inequality usa inaccurate absolves minority responsibility whatsoever say maintain status quo continue calling one another n word continue murdering one another murdered black people killed another black person perfectly fine movie teach circumstance may non black use n word rub black person hair manipulate black people killing non black people disney commended least attempting address subject alone cause c l bre prompting many reviewer trip gush film least address evenhanded responsible fashion,2016-03,239,2.8342604129137885

Creators find humour lurking in the remotest corners of the fauna and squeeze out every bit to ensure that you have a great time. Zootopia is brimming up like a carnival where all sorts of animals live in harmony together and basically coexist to comically impede the story with their cussing and nagging letting their animal instinctive jargon to make things exciting.The story-line begins way back in time, and then quickly takes the plot up in the vanguard the moment Judy Hopps reaches Zootopia with her dream job.

Even though the trailers weren't particularly exciting for me, I had been told it is excellent and worth seeing by just about everyone who had seen it. For the most part, I think they're right. I would say that it is almost on par with Inside Out on how clever it can get.Set in a world populated with anthropomorphic animals, a young rabbit cop named Judy (voiced by Ginnifer.Goodwin) is forced to work hand in hand with a sly con-artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman) to uncover a conspiracy involving the mysterious disappearance of some of the ""predator"" animals populating their city of ""Zootopia"".Despite the film's seemingly cute look, it delves pretty deep into some dark subject matter and themes such as discrimination, prejudice, class status and even attempted murder. However, it still manages to maintain that Disney family charm and never goes so far as to alienate younger audiences. The film's animation was great to look at and brightly coloured, and the world of Zootopia felt alive and vibrant. Jason Bateman, who I am used to seeing as a straight man in most comedies, was great as the wise cracking Nick, as was Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy.

7,2017-01-22,"Set in an alternate universe without humans in which all mammals live harmoniously in cities, the world's first rabbit police officer forms an uneasy alliance with a fox to solve a mystery in this Disney animated feature film. The movie does a surprisingly good job mixing and a balancing various genres: it is part comedy, part adventure, part mystery, part fantasy, and in amongst all that it has some nifty messages to offer with the species prejudices on display coming quite close to racism in human society today. None of this is particularly subtle with the dialogue frequently spelling out the film's racial agenda, but it is thought-provoking nonetheless and the way the rabbit objects to be called cute even offers a poke at workplace sexism. Solid as the film's messages may be, the film's best achievement is how genuinely funny it is, full of audience-winking quips (""life isn't some cartoon"") and eccentric supporting characters, especially a yak voiced by Tommy Chong. The rabbit's neighbours (only heard; never seen) have some particularly amusing things to say; ""it might be worse!"" comments one of them through the wall after hearing our heroine philosophise about tomorrow like Scarlett O'Hara. And on the subject of movie references, the film features one of the best 'Godfather' spoofs of recent years too.

However: they're funnier, I have to point out, than most of the jokes in this film, BUT... Most of the story line in general I shrug off as unfairly simplified for children. It's a cutesy pie way to simplify our situation in America, I expect nothing less from Disney. It feels like this is a movie to be watched and then discussed with children, and with adults, just after.The anthropomorphism of the animals is both over-cooked (way overdone and nothing new) and kind of funny at times (naked yoga animals and Department of Mammal Vehicles, was it? Lol). I agree with some of the comments: its hypocritical criticism of the stereotyping of ""the other"" while blatantly regurgitating stereotypical characters is kind of annoying and not cleverly done.The obvious and surface message of acceptance is great but like others have mentioned it's ridiculous that even in animation cops can get away with anything and some characters are exempt from accountability of their ""bad"" behaviour...

It was called Enchanted, and it had a brand new concept at its base. It had the normal Disney conventions turned upside-down. It was fresh and charming and it gave the entire Disney universe a brand new attitude. I really loved it, I still find Enchanted to be one of the best ever made by the studios. But than, somebody important fell in love with this novel approach to the world, they also realized they could now remake every film they ever made with this new attitude, that meant a whole lot of new scripts written with the same twist in the plot and the TTT era was born. TTT - namely Turned Tables Trend. Thus came into the world The Princess and the Frog, Frozen, Tangled, Alice in Wonderland and many more. Many of these were real nice movies, but they all have the idea of retelling the story in a new, more modern way. Where, neither good nor evil will be exactly what we thought it would be. Like all ideas, it wasn't good or bad as is, it was a new idea - for the Disney Studios, it meant, in a manner of speaking that they did arrive into our modern world. But sometimes it became all consuming. That's how bad movies such as Maleficent and Into the Woods were born, when the idea of twisting the plot became everything and nothing else was important.Now all that was mostly about the history of recent cinema, but I'm both a history buff and a cinema buff, so I do apologize for the digression. All I wanted to say, that for me, this is the best movie made by Disney since that trend took over. It's the best because while this concept is still there, it doesn't control the movie - the story does. It does mean that the end is not so very unpredictable, but I don't mind that all that much.

I wouldn't suggest it for children, as the plot is hardly understandable even adults. By understandable I mean exciting. This movie just happened. No memories left. No magic left. It's hard to write anything cause the movie was empty. Disappointing. I love Lion the King, Tangled, WALL-E, Hercules, but this movie is a disgrace! It is full of humor for adults, crappy humor by the way. Children sitting behind me asked their father: ""Can we go home, please"", and it was just 30 minutes of movie.

9,2016-06-08,"Zootopia promises to entertain you right from the beginning till the end. This is probably one of those rare times when Disney has taken a shot on suspense and it has done brilliantly well on it.Story (10/10): Full marks to the story which is probably the most profound story I have seen after Inside Out. Zootopia talks about the struggles of the only bunny cop - Judy Hopps - town has, and the challenges she faces while performing her duties due to various stereotypes. It is very hard to stay put against the disgust and bullying of everyone, which is beautifully depicted through Judy Hopps characterization. The writer has created a complete contrast character, Nick Wilde, a fox, who gives up against those same stereotypes. He, ironically, helps her in solving the case involving mysterious turn of events in the city. The story has very interesting twists and turns almost every now and then which keeps you wondering what will happen next. The other characters like Chief Bogo, Bellweather, Bonnie and Stu Hopps are very well conceptualized where they all are bound by their preconceived notions, ambitions and greed that pretty much is a microcosm of what Zootopia town has been.Animation (8/10): The level of animation has been good. The creativity that went behind projecting the city and its various facets is outstanding. Although Hollywood has moved slightly ahead but Zootopia stay puts.Direction (9/10): The trio of Byron Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush have done a great job in keeping the story moving and bringing in twists and turns all the time which keeps the audience glued to their seats. Bringing in Shakira for the song, ""Try Everything"" and the novelty in the end credits is simply brilliant.Overall (9/10): Overall, it is a very refreshing movie which brings in something brand new from Disney.

7,2016-03-15,"Yes, it's a Disney movie about talking animals. And yes, it's deservedly kicking butt at the global box office.Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a rabbit from an idyllic rural community. Her risk-evasive parents just want her to be a farmer, but Hopps has bigger ideas. She's heading to Zootropolis to chase her dream of being a cop. While on traffic duty she meets Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a sly fox skilled in the ways of the hustle. When Hopps lucks into a missing person case, she teams up with Wilde to uncover the mystery. It's bigger than they thought. Turns out predators are regressing to their aggressive primal state, frothing and speechless; and there's a cover-up which goes right to the top. Fox and bunny must work together to solve the case.The ""Zootopia"" of the (better) US title refers to Hopps' belief that the city is a place of infinite diversity and complete harmony. To quote the Hail, Caesar!: Would that it were so simple. Zootropolis is a place of tensions and prejudices between its animal citizens. One of those prejudices is carried by Hopps herself: she carries fox repellent spray wherever she goes. There's the first Big Theme of the movie: entrenched assumptions about the dangerous otherness of others.The city itself is split into clear sections – desert, ice, jungle etc – like a Super Mario Bros map. It makes for a nonsensical but utterly beautiful environment. It's populated by all manner of creatures great and small. The movie directly addresses Disney's historic fascination with anthropomorphising beasts. There's even a slightly awkward visual acknowledgement of cartoon animals' lack of genitalia.For a feature cartoon we get an unusually coherent plot, channelling some enjoyable buddy cop and detective thriller tropes. And the script delivers mercifully few ironic, immersion-breaking wisecracks.Caricatures abound, of course, but Hopps and Wilde are nicely sketched characters whose backstories of being bullied mirror each other's. They also mirror the broader social issues the film addresses.This is a timely film, what with Mr Trump sowing the seeds of fear and hatred and appealing to base rage as a release valve. Zootropolis's final manifesto is unapologetically liberal: one of finding common ground as a way of accommodating diversity. We are evolved, it says, so that we might seek an alternative to resolving difference through our most basic animal instincts. Existence precedes essence, not the other way around.Hopps gets a Big Speech at the end where she spells out the themes and moral messages of the film, just in case they went over the heads of younger viewers – or possibly adults who genuinely believe what they've seen is 'just for kids'.So, while a barrel of fun and full of jokes (many of them visual, rewarding repeated viewings), this is a surprisingly thoughtful and sober film. It has its fair share of slapstick, but isn't stuffed with interminable action sequences. We definitely don't get the Marvelisation that almost spoiled Big Hero 6 in the final act. The big and clever showdown here is resolved through the use of imagination; and imagination is the key to empathy; and empathy is the key to a tolerant society. Nice writing.Inside Out was about human consciousness. Zootropolis is all about social conscience. Maybe it doesn't hit the heights of Pixar's masterpiece, but it wouldn't look out of place in the filmography of that lauded studio. Zootropolis may be a struggle for very young ones, but it is consistently entertaining and valuable viewing for smart nippers and adults alike.",585,en,yes disney movie talking animal yes deservedly kicking butt global box office judy hopps voiced ginnifer goodwin rabbit idyllic rural community risk evasive parent want farmer hopps bigger idea heading zootropolis chase dream cop traffic duty meet nick wilde jason bateman sly fox skilled way hustle hopps luck missing person case team wilde uncover mystery bigger thought turn predator regressing aggressive primal state frothing speechless cover go right top fox bunny must work together solve case zootopia better u title refers hopps belief city place infinite diversity complete harmony quote hail caesar would simple zootropolis place tension prejudice animal citizen one prejudice carried hopps carry fox repellent spray wherever go first big theme movie entrenched assumption dangerous otherness others city split clear section desert ice jungle etc like super mario bros map make nonsensical utterly beautiful environment populated manner creature great small movie directly address disney historic fascination anthropomorphising beast even slightly awkward visual acknowledgement cartoon animal lack genitalia feature cartoon get unusually coherent plot channelling enjoyable buddy cop detective thriller trope script delivers mercifully ironic immersion breaking wisecrack caricature abound course hopps wilde nicely sketched character whose backstories bullied mirror also mirror broader social issue film address timely film mr trump sowing seed fear hatred appealing base rage release valve zootropolis final manifesto unapologetically liberal one finding common ground way accommodating diversity evolved say might seek alternative resolving difference basic animal instinct existence precedes essence way around hopps get big speech end spell theme moral message film case went head younger viewer possibly adult genuinely believe seen kid barrel fun full joke many visual rewarding repeated viewing surprisingly thoughtful sober film fair share slapstick stuffed interminable action sequence definitely get marvelisation almost spoiled big hero final act big clever showdown resolved use imagination imagination key empathy empathy key tolerant society nice writing inside human consciousness zootropolis social conscience maybe hit height pixar masterpiece look place filmography lauded studio zootropolis may struggle young one consistently entertaining valuable viewing smart nipper adult alike,2016-03,332,2.5022203955449718

Finally with lot of recommendations I have watched it with high expectations and it has reached to my level of expectations. One word I can say, it is truly a 'Masterpiece', Walt Disney Animation Studios just nailed it after their successful venture Big Hero 6, couple of years ago. This is 55th Animated feature film from their classic animated series of films. Unlike other animated films, Zootopia has a perfect mystery plot with a message added to it. In fact if you take the story with out any animation, it has really good potential. Clearly we can say that it is an perfect commercial action-mystery oriented script with heavy animation touch. Graphics, Dubbing & Cinematography were undoubtedly top-notch. Zootopia on the surface, beneath the surface, and everywhere in between is essentially flawless. Through its importance with a riveting plot & eye-candy graphics, Zootopia will stand as one of the best works of animation for this entire decade.

Zootopia is going to smash the holiday box office open as it is intelligent and fun the whole way through. The big thing to consider for this movie is whether it is suitable for young children. I had already read some reviews that were saying 5 and 6 years olds may find some scenes scary. And that could be true. I didn't think the boo scenes were that startling, there is really only one jump moment in the whole thing that made everyone leap out of their seats. The part I found most intense was the language. It is not swearing but the characters are rather forceful with their words. If you are uncomfortable with characters aggressively scratching or pushing each other while they say things like ""you jerk, shut up"", then this movie may be too old for your child. The one thing I can say without reserve is that all adults should go see it.

In a city of animals, a talking fox becomes a fugitive after being accused of a crime she didn't commit. The local police officer, the undisputed rabbit, sets out to find her.Review:
""Zootopia"" is a film that delights both children and adults, featuring vibrantly colored animation and charismatic characters. The plot, centered on the rabbit Judy Hopps and the cunning fox Nick Wilde, addresses relevant social issues, such as prejudice, stereotypes, and diversity, in an accessible and educational way.One of the film's highlights is its world-building. Zootopia is an incredible city where different habitats coexist, reflecting the diversity of the real world. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the interactions between different species to how society deals with its tensions.Furthermore, the narrative skillfully balances humor and social message. The script features witty dialogue and moving moments, making viewers genuinely connect with the challenges faced by the protagonists. The dynamic between Judy and Nick is not only entertaining but also invites empathy and acceptance of differences.The animation is breathtaking, with a vibrant color palette and an engaging soundtrack that complements the viewing experience. The characters are well-developed and convey a range of emotions, enriching the story.The song ""Try Everything,"" performed by Shakira, adds emotional depth to ""Zootopia,"" encapsulating Judy Hopps's determination and resilience in pursuing her dreams despite challenges. With its inspiring lyrics about not giving up in the face of adversity, the song perfectly resonates with the film's central message, encouraging viewers to believe in resilience and hope, making the cinematic experience even more impactful and memorable.Ultimately, ""Zootopia"" is not just light entertainment; It's an invitation to reflect on our own prejudices and the importance of working together, regardless of appearances. The film conveys a powerful message that true friendship and understanding can overcome barriers, making it a memorable and significant work in animated cinema.",307,en,synopsis city animal talking fox becomes fugitive accused crime commit local police officer undisputed rabbit set find review zootopia film delight child adult featuring vibrantly colored animation charismatic character plot centered rabbit judy hopps cunning fox nick wilde address relevant social issue prejudice stereotype diversity accessible educational way one film highlight world building zootopia incredible city different habitat coexist reflecting diversity real world attention detail remarkable interaction different specie society deal tension furthermore narrative skillfully balance humor social message script feature witty dialogue moving moment making viewer genuinely connect challenge faced protagonist dynamic judy nick entertaining also invite empathy acceptance difference animation breathtaking vibrant color palette engaging soundtrack complement viewing experience character well developed convey range emotion enriching story song try everything performed shakira add emotional depth zootopia encapsulating judy hopps determination resilience pursuing dream despite challenge inspiring lyric giving face adversity song perfectly resonates film central message encouraging viewer believe resilience hope making cinematic experience even impactful memorable ultimately zootopia light entertainment invitation reflect prejudice importance working together regardless appearance film conveys powerful message true friendship understanding overcome barrier making memorable significant work animated cinema,2025-10,186,2.4771023484549075

10,2025-04-05,"I watched Zootopia for the first time when I was 10 years old. I have loved it so much since then that I have seen it over and over again. As a kid, I enjoyed its humor, beautiful animation, and cute characters. But once I grew up, I started to notice more details, especially the architecture of the city. The way Zootopia has something for all creatures from different climates and sizes. The likelihood of all of them existing in this massive city fascinated me so much that I eventually developed a passion for architecture.Zootopia is my most beloved animated movie ever. It has humor and action and deep social issues. Moreover, the animation is beautifully executed with a witty script and a well-constructed plot. The animation raises today's themes, such as prejudice and discrimination, while still remaining fun and exciting to every kind of audience.The story starts with our main character, Judy Hopps. She is a rabbit who is the first in her species to join the Zootopia Police Force. She believes in justice and fairness. However, things are not as easy when her boss gives her parking duty instead of sending her on a mission to protect others from criminals and solve real crimes just because she is a ""rabbit."" Because she was frustrated, she decided to solve a mysterious missing mammal case where only the predators went missing. She teams up with Nick Wilde, a sly fox who is a con artist. As they dig deeper, they discover that the case is bigger than they ever expected. In the end, they learn a shocking truth that threatens their society.The film does an excellent job of combining comedy, mystery, and good social messages. It shows how prejudice and stereotyping affect society and how teamwork and perseverance can overcome them. Adding to that, I adored the character development that led to the uplifting story.In my opinion, the city is the most impressive part of the film. Zootopia is designed to keep all the animals within 6 districts. They include Sahara Square, Tundratown, Rainforest District, Savanna Central, Little Rodentia, and Meadowlands. The transport system is very inclusive, with more-than-one-sized doors and sidewalks for animals of any size, ranging from mice to elephants. It even has separate routes to cater to different species. What really fascinated me was how different environments are merged into one city with advanced transportation systems linking them. This is one of the main reasons that drew me to architecture as I grew up.I highly, highly recommend Zootopia to all, both children and adults. It is funny, visually stunning, and thought-provoking. It can be a comedy or a film with more serious social themes. It just depends on what you want. To me, it is more than a fun movie. It is the film that influenced me to pursue a major in architecture.",476,en,watched zootopia first time year old loved much since seen kid enjoyed humor beautiful animation cute character grew started notice detail especially architecture city way zootopia something creature different climate size likelihood existing massive city fascinated much eventually developed passion architecture zootopia beloved animated movie ever humor action deep social issue moreover animation beautifully executed witty script well constructed plot animation raise today theme prejudice discrimination still remaining fun exciting every kind audience story start main character judy hopps rabbit first specie join zootopia police force belief justice fairness however thing easy bos give parking duty instead sending mission protect others criminal solve real crime rabbit frustrated decided solve mysterious missing mammal case predator went missing team nick wilde sly fox con artist dig deeper discover case bigger ever expected end learn shocking truth threatens society film excellent job combining comedy mystery good social message show prejudice stereotyping affect society teamwork perseverance overcome adding adored character development led uplifting story opinion city impressive part film zootopia designed keep animal within district include sahara square tundratown rainforest district savanna central little rodentia meadowlands transport system inclusive one sized door sidewalk animal size ranging mouse elephant even separate route cater different specie really fascinated different environment merged one city advanced transportation system linking one main reason drew architecture grew highly highly recommend zootopia child adult funny visually stunning thought provoking comedy film serious social theme depends want fun movie film influenced pursue major architecture,2025-04,242,2.488097724663207

7,2016-03-03,"This movie is really disappointing to me. I've seen some of Disney's best, and this isn't it -- but it easily could have been. When I saw Zootopia's teaser trailer months ago before ""Inside Out"", it looked like a solid premise: ""animals live like people but retain some of their wild traits"". It doesn't take an amazing premise to make an amazing movie. ""Frozen"" and ""The Lion King"" are awesome movies not because of the setup for their story, but because of how the story is told. They feel like care was put into their world.Zootopia takes a lazier, more adult approach to creativity. You can see this same problem in ""The Lego Movie"", most kids' movies, and many episodes of ""Family Guy"". The laziest humor you can have is referential humor, and Zootopia's references cheapen the clever jokes it also has. Given this animal world, there's room for a lot of funny jokes and puns based on traits audiences are familiar with. One that Disney gets a lot of mileage out of is how many offspring rabbits tend to create (the main character has around 180 siblings). And those jokes are really funny because they only make sense in the world of Zootopia.It's a lot lazier to make an iPhone, make it look like an iPhone, and change the Apple logo to a carrot logo. On another phone, we see a photos app whose interface and logo look a lot like Google Photos. In ""Toy Story 3"", there's a ripoff of a Macbook, and it *enhances* the story - these are real toys in the real human world, interacting with a real brand of computers. What is so exciting about Zootopia is it gives its writers and animators a chance to make its own unique world. Any relationship with the human world should serve a logical purpose within the animal world as well. Otherwise, it's like the animal world of Zootopia doesn't even exist. (This is done well, for example, when a train car has three sets of doors, for big, medium, and small animal). ""Wreck-It Ralph"" puts more care into its world than Zootopia does.There's an extended reference to ""The Godfather"" which has lots of references and not much original humor. It's disappointing to have boring references like this alongside creative, funny jokes that build off of Zootopia's world. I laughed a lot at the lame costumes at a school play in the film.Perhaps the most tasteless joke in the entire movie is that lemmings follow each other. They don't, and they never have. This myth was created BY Disney in the 1950s. Not only is it weird to have fake animal behaviors in a movie seemingly obsessed with cataloging real ones, it's insulting to be reminded of Disney's past animal abuse. There are animals that move in herds, and a joke that bison or sheep all scrambled in a herd to buy a ""pawpsicle"" is not much of a stretch from the existing joke.Like its comedy, the rest of Zootopia is uneven. Jason Bateman puts in a great performance as a mischievous fox. He channels the conniving behavior his ""Arrested Development"" character had in that show's final season. The animation is rarely jawdropping. Dreamworks or Sony could have animated this movie, and very little would be different. Even the fur of the animals doesn't look that fluffy or fun, except in rare scenes. I was more blown away by ""Frozen"", and that was over two years ago. ""Frozen"" had incredible bright lighting, shimmering water reflections, and sparkly snow and ice. In Zootopia, there's a good montage of all the climates its city has to offer. Also, there is an ""Avatar""-style serene misty floaty jungle type of place, but other than that, it's a pretty normal city with a fairly normal visual style.The story kept me interested in the movie but is not one I want to go back to. A rabbit cop is tasked with solving the disappearance of an otter. There's some interesting, yet obvious subtext that is expressed reasonably well. It's relevant in the era of Donald Trump, but says little that hasn't been said in countless other movies. When movies like ""Frozen"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" have an average story, they can fall back on their incredible visuals and thrilling music. Zootopia has no traditional musical numbers, and the vocal song that plays through the rabbit's phone early in the film isn't nearly as catchy as ""Under the Sea"", nor is it as rich with meaning as ""Let It Go"". I like its message, saying that trying new things and making mistakes is an important part of life, but didn't find it as engaging as some pop hits like ""Raise Your Glass"". The instrumental soundtrack (from the composer for ""Inside Out"" and ""The Incredibles"") was more up my alley. I specifically noticed how cool ""Ticket to Write"" was - it has a laid-back, tropical vibe.Good animal stories can be told. Disney made The Lion King. Other companies made ""Cats Don't Dance"", ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", and ""Finding Nemo"". The TV show ""Polar Bear's Cafe"" has inventive animal comedy. What saddens me with Zootopia is that you get bits of cynicism, that the filmmakers are so above it all. ""We didn't make our own Google logo because we didn't have to"". ""We copied human sensibilities for pop stars because that's what people recognize"". The implication is that kids are too stupid to know the difference between attention to detail and sloppiness, and the cynicism and references to real life are there to keep parents from wanting to leave the theater.

The film had fantastic characters, animation, and adult (semi) references, but its lack of clarification on its exposition, and forced relationship issues just bogged down the movie a little too much, to the point where I felt the need to dock the movie for those issues.

7,2016-09-18,"One of the most recent additions to the billion dollar box office club, it's safe to say Disney would be quite happy with the performance of their animated hit Zootopia.A film filled to the brim with colour, life and a pace that barely allows you to question the ethics behind an animated film having references to Uber, Breaking Bad and religion (not to mention a nudist club), Bryon Howard, Rich Moore and Jared Bush's film is an animated tale perfectly suited to today's climate of acceptance and feminist driven protagonists and with its skewering to those a little older than the average Disney target, Zootopia is thankfully a film adults can find themselves enjoying while the rugrats take in the sights and sounds of a world run by animals of all shapes and sizes.Zootopia begins in a seemingly run of the mill fashion as determined little bunny Judy Hopps (voiced with energy by Ginnifer Goodwin) decides she's going to shun her carrot loving heritage to become a police officer, but Zootopia quickly morphs into a fairly intriguing mystery as Judy finds herself teaming up with the on face value dastardly fox Nick Wilde (voiced to perfection by Jason Bateman) to solve the disappearance of a raft of animals from the city. It's nice to have an animated film steer away from the overused hero's v villains stereotypes that have infested the animated staples of recent years and while the film reverts back to a sadly rather generic finale, Zootopia has done enough in the lead up that we don't really mind to much at all.Perhaps slightly undeserving of some of the high praise it received upon release at years start, Zootopia is still undoubtedly a whole lot of fun for the whole family even though some of the younger members of the clan may not exactly get what on earth is going on at times. With efforts like these it's even likely that one day soon the Disney animated staple may in fact overtake their Pixar branches title as king of the CGI world.3 ½ Godfather rats out of 5",350,en,one recent addition billion dollar box office club safe say disney would quite happy performance animated hit zootopia film filled brim colour life pace barely allows question ethic behind animated film reference uber breaking bad religion mention nudist club bryon howard rich moore jared bush film animated tale perfectly suited today climate acceptance feminist driven protagonist skewering little older average disney target zootopia thankfully film adult find enjoying rugrats take sight sound world run animal shape size zootopia begin seemingly run mill fashion determined little bunny judy hopps voiced energy ginnifer goodwin decides going shun carrot loving heritage become police officer zootopia quickly morphs fairly intriguing mystery judy find teaming face value dastardly fox nick wilde voiced perfection jason bateman solve disappearance raft animal city nice animated film steer away overused hero v villain stereotype infested animated staple recent year film reverts back sadly rather generic finale zootopia done enough lead really mind much perhaps slightly undeserving high praise received upon release year start zootopia still undoubtedly whole lot fun whole family even though younger member clan may exactly get earth going time effort like even likely one day soon disney animated staple may fact overtake pixar branch title king cgi world godfather rat,2016-09,204,2.3087877798075342
5,2017-02-17,"So I enjoyed the film. The action, some of the characters and the invention of the makers was really good.However, I did begin to feel the nausea of preachy moralising becoming a little too hard to swallow or rather overtaking the film about half way through.Yes, it's good to embolden children and individuals that they can be what they want to be but it shouldn't be at the behest of others. I've no problems with women being in the army and on the front line but they should be able to do exactly the same as what a man can.Bending the rules or turning a blind to physical inadequacies are fine in the classroom but get to the front line when someone is incapable of physically carrying a fellow wounded soldier or lugging that ammo crate around and your well meaning positive discrimination leads to a less than effective fighting force.Even so I was cool with Hopps getting through the selection (albeit off the literal backs of others) though I started to feel the embrace of political correctness when the front desk guy was remonstrated for calling her cute (with it's less than subtle nod to the n word).Okay, that's still fine as the world we are being presented with in the film is fun and entertaining. The sloths are hilarious and it's all bright and shiny.But half way through the messaging that we are wrong to judge people and the moral posturing began to get a little overwhelming. Yes, a utopia of rivers of chocolate and laughing children and never needing to lock your front door is all very nice but it seemed to be preaching that anyone who didn't think this utopia was achievable was evil or in some way morally corrupt.It didn't seem to be a case of acting on what's right in your heart, tempered with your head, but acting on what the liberal intelligentsia are telling you is right.

6,2021-01-04,"This 2016 Walt Disney computer animated film is the 55th Animated Disney feature. It has a rating of PG making it suitable for any age group, and it has a runtime of 108 minutes. Depending where you live geographically you may know this film as ""Zootopia"" or ""Zootropolis"". Directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore (with co-direction by Jared Bush), this is a buddy cop movie in a world where anthropomorphic animals co-exist.Judy Hopps becomes the first rabbit police officer to graduate to the Zootropolis Police department, during her first assignment she gets hustled by minor con-artist fox duo Nick Wilde (red fox) and Finnick (Fennec Fox). Her boss, Chief Bogo is ready to fire her when she takes on an impossible case; to find and recover Emmitt Otterton and thirteen other animals who have gone missing. She enlists Nick Wilde in the investigation as he may have been one of the last animals to see Mr Otterton. The investigation takes the two on a journey of discovery, about themselves, and the coexistence of animals in Zootropolis, and about who holds the power and what they are doing with it.This is a fun and enjoyable Disney film which ticks all the feelgood boxes that Disney films regularly This is a fun and enjoyable Disney film which ticks all the feelgood boxes that Disney films regularly tick. It is colourful and engaging, while having a story which can be followed by all. It is not too complicated that younger audiences cannot appreciate the fun of what's going on; and it's not too simple that an older audience can't be entertained by the complexities of the buddy cop plot. Among all the professionally written and delivered characters on show there were plenty of gags and homages to other films, take Mr Big for example, the Marlon Brando style ""Godfather"". There were also some cleverly transposed animals in positions you could easily imagine them; for example, a Lion being the major/leader of the pack or Flash the Sloth in a government position where everything happens slowly. While commenting on this I must also point out, as good as it is visually and as good as some of the characters are perceived - if you read into the film from a morality point of view (which a lot of people do), then you will find a bit of a mess here too. For example, there is a lot of virtue-signalling and morality being suggested in this film, which then goes on to make some of the delivery that is occurred a little hypocritical. There are veiled discussion of racism, sexism, and xenophobia on show, which then get easily dismissed for the purpose of happy closure in the feature. Historically Disney does not have the best track record when it comes to morals and isms in its features and unfortunately this does have its issues too. Rather than focus on those failings and commentate on how this makes Disney hypocritical of its chequered past I am going to sidestep them and just focus on the film. It is fun, it is colourful, the voice acting is good, and it kept me entertaining for the runtime. I do not regret watching it and heck, when I put my 4-year-old cousin in front of this he loved it too and never took his eyes off it. That is what this film should be judged on, and not judging and over-analysing it. At his age I was the same too, it was colourful and entertaining. So, as a spectacle and vehicle to pass time it is good, great in fact. It is pretty, it is entertaining, it has giggles, and it has fun and occasionally cute animals that are voiced wonderfully. Therefore, it is a film I am happy to recommend to audiences young and old. 6/10",639,en,walt disney computer animated film th animated disney feature rating pg making suitable age group runtime minute depending live geographically may know film zootopia zootropolis directed byron howard rich moore co direction jared bush buddy cop movie world anthropomorphic animal co exist judy hopps becomes first rabbit police officer graduate zootropolis police department first assignment get hustled minor con artist fox duo nick wilde red fox finnick fennec fox bos chief bogo ready fire take impossible case find recover emmitt otterton thirteen animal gone missing enlists nick wilde investigation may one last animal see mr otterton investigation take two journey discovery coexistence animal zootropolis hold power fun enjoyable disney film tick feelgood box disney film regularly fun enjoyable disney film tick feelgood box disney film regularly tick colourful engaging story followed complicated younger audience cannot appreciate fun going simple older audience entertained complexity buddy cop plot among professionally written delivered character show plenty gag homage film take mr big example marlon brando style godfather also cleverly transposed animal position could easily imagine example lion major leader pack flash sloth government position everything happens slowly commenting must also point good visually good character perceived read film morality point view lot people find bit mess example lot virtue signalling morality suggested film go make delivery occurred little hypocritical veiled discussion racism sexism xenophobia show get easily dismissed purpose happy closure feature historically disney best track record come moral ism feature unfortunately issue rather focus failing commentate make disney hypocritical chequered past going sidestep focus film fun colourful voice acting good kept entertaining runtime regret watching heck put year old cousin front loved never took eye film judged judging analysing age colourful entertaining spectacle vehicle pas time good great fact pretty entertaining giggle fun occasionally cute animal voiced wonderfully therefore film happy recommend audience young old,2021-01,303,2.514362913681145
9,2016-03-09,"There's no denying that Disney Animation Studios' output in current years has been hit or miss, with Disney's best animated features being those helmed by Pixar. I am happy to report that Zootopia can stand toe-to-toe with most of Pixar's films. It starts with a great script. This script is funny, very funny. But it is also relatable, heartfelt and timely. There has been much discussion and praise of the films messages of embracing diversity and not giving up on one's dreams. While that latter message is a common theme in most family fare, the points the film makes about diversity couldn't be coming along at a better time. Many of us watch the news and see the stories of unarmed minorities being harmed or killed by police officers, or protests over the Oscars' lack of nominee diversity, and we realize there is truth and relevance to many of these issues. But how often do we stop to think about how our kids are responding to these things? They often watch, read and hear the same news we do. The main theme of Zootopia is not judging others based on their ""species"" and avoiding common misconceptions and stereotypes about anyone who may not come from the same origins you do. Admittedly, the movie beats this point more than a dirty rug (a skunk-butt-rug perhaps? You'll see.). But it doesn't interfere at all with the movie's enjoyment factor. Aside from an extremely witty script, we have a well-cast group of actors bringing life to a plethora of unique new characters. In the lead is Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, Zootopia's first bunny cop. One thing that set Disney's classics apart was their creation of unique and memorable characters. Think Genie from Aladdin, Dopey from Snow White, the White Rabbit from Alice In Wonderland or Timon & Pumba from The Lion King-characters that have thrived in the pop culture ether long after their movies' releases. Judy Hopps is one of Disney's best new characters in years and she deserves to be every bit as memorable as those others I mentioned. She could have thrived on the cute factor alone, but she is much more three-dimensional than that. She has experienced real bullying and prejudice in her life but insists on enduring through whatever others throw at her so she can become a cop and ""make the world a better place"". She's clever, funny and even a little flawed, making her easy to connect with and root for. Jason Bateman costars as the sly fox Nick Wilde, who must learn throughout the film to look past his cynical view of the world and his own selfish attitude. As a Jason Bateman fan, I was glad to see him lending his famously sarcastic tone to this project. In his character's first few scenes I wasn't sure he was the right fit, but once Wilde and Hopps partner up, his range kicks in as his character faces a new emotional journey. The supporting cast includes Idris Elba, Bonnie Hunt, Tommy Chong, J.K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Maurice Lamarche, Jenny Slate and Shakira as a pop star named Gazelle who treats us to a fun concert during the end credits. Nate Terrance gets one of the film's best supporting roles as Clawhauser, the police department's front desk officer-a fat, goofy, over-the-top, donut-loving cheetah. He and Judy get one of the best scenes in the movie when he uses a certain word to describe her and she responds with a friendly ""only bunnies can use that word"" attitude. It is obvious what real world scenario this scene is mirroring, and it is a very clever part of the movie's diversity message. All these characters are part of the movie's great mystery-why has there been a disappearance of multiple mammals, and why, in an evolved society where all animals live in supposed harmony, are some animals turning ""savage"" and attacking others? I certainly won't spoil it here; and while the big reveal may be a tad predictable, it fits the film well. The pacing is near perfect, never does the movie feel like it's dragging or rushed. The sloths at the DMV scene featured in the film's second trailer is probably the funniest scene in the movie. However, there is a little more to it and even though I had already seen it multiple times, it still brought me to tears laughing in the theater. Thankfully, there's plenty more great lines and gags throughout to keep the laughs coming. Obviously, with any animated feature, the quality of the animation is an important factor. Zootopia looks great. It may not be jaw-dropping like The Good Dinosaur, but all the images are well drawn and crisply rendered. There is also nice attention to detail throughout-little things like the carrots on Bonnie Hopps' skirt, Judy's activity tracker watch, and Mrs. Otterton's thread-pilling sweater. Characters' fur looks to stand out and flow naturally. It is clear directors Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush and their animation team set out to make a visually satisfying movie experience that doesn't skimp on animation quality. Disney should be proud of their latest effort. Zootopia works well not just as a animated movie or family film-but just as a good movie period. I certainly wouldn't oppose going to see it again. It works on multiple levels and should be appealing to the whole family. 9/10",900,en,denying disney animation studio output current year hit miss disney best animated feature helmed pixar happy report zootopia stand toe toe pixar film start great script script funny funny also relatable heartfelt timely much discussion praise film message embracing diversity giving one dream latter message common theme family fare point film make diversity coming along better time many u watch news see story unarmed minority harmed killed police officer protest oscar lack nominee diversity realize truth relevance many issue often stop think kid responding thing often watch read hear news main theme zootopia judging others based specie avoiding common misconception stereotype anyone may come origin admittedly movie beat point dirty rug skunk butt rug perhaps see interfere movie enjoyment factor aside extremely witty script well cast group actor bringing life plethora unique new character lead ginnifer goodwin judy hopps zootopia first bunny cop one thing set disney classic apart creation unique memorable character think genie aladdin dopey snow white white rabbit alice wonderland timon pumba lion king character thrived pop culture ether long movie release judy hopps one disney best new character year deserves every bit memorable others mentioned could thrived cute factor alone much three dimensional experienced real bullying prejudice life insists enduring whatever others throw become cop make world better place clever funny even little flawed making easy connect root jason bateman costars sly fox nick wilde must learn throughout film look past cynical view world selfish attitude jason bateman fan glad see lending famously sarcastic tone project character first scene sure right fit wilde hopps partner range kick character face new emotional journey supporting cast includes idris elba bonnie hunt tommy chong j k simmons octavia spencer alan tudyk maurice lamarche jenny slate shakira pop star named gazelle treat u fun concert end credit nate terrance get one film best supporting role clawhauser police department front desk officer fat goofy top donut loving cheetah judy get one best scene movie us certain word describe responds friendly bunny use word attitude obvious real world scenario scene mirroring clever part movie diversity message character part movie great mystery disappearance multiple mammal evolved society animal live supposed harmony animal turning savage attacking others certainly spoil big reveal may tad predictable fit film well pacing near perfect never movie feel like dragging rushed sloth dmv scene featured film second trailer probably funniest scene movie however little even though already seen multiple time still brought tear laughing theater thankfully plenty great line gag throughout keep laugh coming obviously animated feature quality animation important factor zootopia look great may jaw dropping like good dinosaur image well drawn crisply rendered also nice attention detail throughout little thing like carrot bonnie hopps skirt judy activity tracker watch mr otterton thread pilling sweater character fur look stand flow naturally clear director byron howard rich moore jared bush animation team set make visually satisfying movie experience skimp animation quality disney proud latest effort zootopia work well animated movie family film good movie period certainly oppose going see work multiple level appealing whole family,2016-03,506,2.439978930352884
7,2016-09-20,"Zootopia is an easy movie to describe. That's neither a compliment nor a criticism, but for the most part this is a pretty straight forward movie. It's about an underdog who rises up to the top (after facing many difficulties, of course); we follow this underdog - Hopper - as she investigates the case of a missing person - a case which get larger and larger as the movie goes on. It follows a very standard formula (the storytelling technique is nothing more than the cop finds the first clue, which leads to second clue, which leads to third clue, etc, until eventually they find the big bad villain). It probably sounds familiar as this is the basic storyline to most detective movies, especially animated ones. But instead of conforming to complete conventionality as you might it would, Zootopia boosts itself by adding in some refreshingly new ideas for such a movie. It's a movie with a valuable message laid out throughout, about not stereotyping or labelling people, and looking past outward appearances. Although it debatable gets a little too preachy at times, you still have to commend the movie for trying to teach the younger end of the audience a very valuable lesson.The movie never quite hits any of those belly-laugh moments that you often find in a Pixar movie (although one particular scene with a sloth is hilarious), but the humour is good enough to keep older audiences entertained, although most of the humour would certainly work better with a child.

7,2016-03-06,"Maintaining a creepy mustache is a lifestyle choice. One of the unfortunate consequences of said lifestyle choice is being forced to feel awkward whenever you go see a children's movie, alone, in a dark theatre, filled to the brim with excited youths. Zootopia makes almost all of that awkwardness worth the trip.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is an ambitious, young bunny, looking to prove herself as the first rabbit police officer in the bustling metropolis of Zootopia. Seen as little more than meek prey by her coworkers, peers, and even her family, she must learn to overcome these prejudices, and work with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a cunning fox, to crack an impenetrable case.From Disney, you'd expect nothing less than top notch animation, and Zootopia undoubtedly delivers on that front. The colors are vibrant, playful, and inviting, as we move from dense, jungle rainforests, to blisteringly icy tundras, to urban cityscapes. The lighting, especially, is awe inspiring, specifically during Mr. Big's (Maurice LaMarche) daughter's wedding. It makes the entire sequence feel ethereal, if not like an altogether blatant homage to The Godfather.The voice acting, too, is excellent. Idris Elba is an intimidating presence as Chief Bogo, and Ginnifer Goodwin is totally endearing and lovable in a role that could have, in lesser hands, devolved into something saccharine and obnoxious. The real standout, however, is Jason Bateman, who consistently reminds me how he is one of the most versatile and underrated workhorses in Hollywood. He delivers a brassy, jaded performance, that is somehow imbued with the charisma and charm of a young Robert Redford. Bateman's Nick Wilde is a total dick, but goddamn it if I don't love that dick.As it claws tenaciously at greatness, Zootopia is tethered to the realm of merely good Disney films by its script. Sure, there are a handful of legitimately funny jokes (and one bizarrely out of place Breaking Bad reference) peppered in for some strong laughs, but the plot is generally predictable, and sticks to tried and true Disney formula. If that formula were perfectly executed, then all would be forgiven, but a sloppy, rushed third act, and an unbearably heavy-handed message that is handled with all of the nuance and discreetness with which crocodile might attack its prey, really hamper the film. It is almost cringe inducing at times, yet a slightly longer running time, and a little dialogue revision would have done the film a world of good.Don't let me scare you off, though. Zootopia is a fine film that definitely earns your money. Whether you're a parent looking for a cheap diversion that'll entertain you and your kids, or a student looking for a harmless, inoffensive flick to watch after midterms, you could do far worse.

8,2016-02-17,"After the tale of two princesses in wintry landscape, action sci-fi with cuddly robot, and now enchanting buddy cop movie with bunny and fox, I will never doubt Disney again. There's something legitimate magical there, as it never fails to bring an ageless spectacle of witty humor, great visual and charming characters. ""Zootopia"" is not only a nice story with social commentary, it's also a detective, dare I say, thriller, which is unexpectedly crazy and brilliant.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is a spirited bunny with one goal in mind; to become a cop, despite whatever her size and other might tell her. Her chirpy nature makes it near impossible not to cheer for her, and this might be the most delightful bunny in decades not named Bugs. Her peculiar partner in crime is Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) who is a con man with possible golden heart hidden inside his shifty golden fur. He's a contrast to Judy, a more realistic type and using sly wit to overcome striking prejudice.These two have excellent chemistry, in a crime thriller style no less. Disney is well known to incorporate action nowadays, but full-fledged detective work, it's mental that this works tremendously well. The pacing moves in haste, and still giving enough hints for the noir to move nicely and the audience to follow it closely. The atmosphere can be dark at several occasions to create dread, yet never too overwhelming for its family friendly nature.Visual is good as expected, it's a nice set-up for animal kingdoms, in the urban environment. There are multiple references for pop and modern culture, in fact some of the jokes come in form of familiar daily life routines. The other bulk is in the expense of Judy as she hits speed bump along the way to accomplish her dream. Still, what could be somber tone is delivered with delectably mocking tone.This is also a forum to delicately show social values without being too heavy-handed. The movie tries to present this serious element and fortunately, it benefits from the mild colorful production to deliver the message in friendly and approachable way.

7,2016-06-16,"It's perhaps not the best Disney movie ever made, but still a very lovable one, and technically absolutely fantastic. (As all Disney CGIs ever.) The characters are lively and lovely, the story is somewhat predictable, but the lore takes it all the way. A ton of cultural references spice it up for adults, from tongue-in-cheek references to Frozen to Godfather and even Breaking Bad. That's all I can tell about it in general. It deserves a 7 out of 10, for it could've been much more than it actually is, yet the storyline could've used some more polishment.A subtly brave movie I called it, and for a reason. It is a movie which actually dares to criticize multicultural society. The whole set is an utopia, a Zootopia, a city where predators and prey live happily together - also, it's an obvious reference to the Bible - but in fact it's only a hollow ideal. Different animals may coexist, but differences can not be set apart. Stereotypes exist for a reason. Foxes are sly, sloths are slow, rabbits are good at multiplying, and so on. This movie doesn't teach kids to act as if there wasn't any difference between members of different social groups. It doesn't propagate Hollywood's usual and banal clichés about racism and prejudice. It doesn't teach that even acknowledging differences is racism. No, it takes a more rational approach. What Zootopia teaches is this: good persons and jerks come in all shape and color, but stereotypes exist for a reason and the world is not a big happy family, even despite having surpassed violent antagonisms.I personally loved Zootopia for this. I am glad that political correctness and social justice warriors did not stop this movie in the making. This is exactly the voice we need in today's madness when liberal and conservative fundamentalism both try to claim the world for themselves. Also, while the city Zootopia is a biblical symbol, there is a much more stronger biblical message at the end. ""Sanctify what you are."" A very nice moral teaching. A fox can't be not a fox.

2,2016-03-29,"As an adult watching Zootopia, I really enjoyed it. The plot is original, engaging, with multiple plot twists and entertaining. Its on a par with Spiderman, Batman and those type of action movies. That is why everyone is giving 10 out of 10. But my 6 year old burst into tears - way way too much violence, fright scenes and explosive action scenes for a Disney Movie, even with parental guidance. I think its very sad that children movie makers feel the need to get children's hearts racing, just to keep them entertained. It was very over-stimulating for my 6 year old. The story plot was good enough without the need for all the over the top action scenes. It was the same as an adult action movie but with animals instead of 'stallone'.

9,2016-06-27,"When it comes to being a parent, part of the deal is to watch kids' films. Sometimes this can be a painful experience - let's just say that my kids and I differ radically in our assessment of Alvin and the $*&^£!*ing Chipmunks. On other occasions, however, the experience can be joyful. I went into this film with low expectations, and unexpectedly had a ball. I honestly found it laugh-out-loud funny, and so did my kids. Moreover, we often laughed at the same scene for different reasons. My kids have never seen the Godfather, for instance, and neither have they (yet) had to deal with a government department whose speed of service would be improved by replacing everyone with sloths - but there were elements in these scenes which worked for them as well as the bits that worked for me. It is very difficult to produce a film that really is for everybody, but this is one of the very best.To be sure, the ""moral lesson"" is clichéd and obvious, many of the characters were simple stereotypes, and the plot twists were more than a little predictable. Such things matter little to kids, however; and I can live with them when things are handled with zest and panache. The action is fast-paced, the acting first-class, the animation state-of-the-art - and the sight-gags are both brilliant, and scattered in such profusion that you probably don't have time to catch them all on one viewing.

8,2016-06-13,"Cute, talking animals are, of course, nothing new when it comes to Disney. Whether they are an anthropomorphic swash-buckler or a wide- eyed human's sidekick, I couldn't name one of Disney's animated output that didn't feature a cuddly creature. Their latest, Zootopia, may seem much more of the same then, with it's richly- imaged world of upright rabbits, polar bears, hippos and the like, all living together in harmony in the titular metropolis. You can put away your preconceptions however, as Zootopia is without doubt the corporate giants bravest and most relevant picture to date, and one with a strong message for its young audience that will hopefully rub off on at least a few viewers.Young, determined bunny Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) grows up in the rural Bunnyburrow, a small town in a larger world where predators and prey have evolved to live together peacefully. Her parents hope she'll grow up to appreciate the quiet life of selling carrots and raising a family, but she has other ideas, and hopes to one day travel to the big city of Zootopia to become a police officer. Despite facing prejudice due to her gender and her size, she eventually graduates from Police Academy top of her class, and is soon in Zootopia fulfilling her dream. But when she arrives, her colleagues instantly doubt her ability as the precinct is traditionally made up of more formidable animals, and is quickly assigned to parking duty by Chief Bogo (Idris Elba).Frustrated at the clear-cut discrimination, Judy decides to be the best parking attendant there ever was. It is while she is stamping every vehicle with a ticket the second they're in violation that she learns that prejudice goes both ways, meeting the seemingly down- and-out fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), the exact kind of prey Judy suffered physical harm from as a child. Her suspicions turn out to be true, and Nick is indeed a 'sly' fox, but comes to learn that he acts like a fox because society treats him and expects him to be like one. Begging for a chance at something more challenging, Bogo gives Judy the task of tracking down missing person Mr. Otterton with an ultimatum that she must resign if she fails. Suspecting his street-smarts may be of an asset to her investigation, Judy blackmails Nick into helping her, and uncover a series of bizarre incidents where predators are returning to their primal state.While it may sound like a heavy-handed educational piece on the folly of racism and pre-judgement, it actually isn't, as Zootopia is also an explosion of imagination for the vast majority of its 110- minute running time. Judy's arrival at Zootopia, as she is whisked through an array of eco-systems, designed to sustain the many different kinds of inhabitants, is a complete joy. While some jokes fail to hit the mark, like the Godfather gag that may have been funny thirty years ago, others are ingenious. It may seem obvious to employs sloths at the DMV, but the scene is still laugh-out-loud even though they played it in it's entirety in the trailer. But Zootopia isn't memorable for its comedy value, but the way it delivers its message. Without being preachy or overly-sentimental, the film actually feel frustrated at society. We have surely evolved past pretty prejudice and stereotyping, so what drives the hate?

7,2016-10-09,"Review: I was quite impressed with this animation movie from Disney, because it looked great and there was actually a decent storyline which kept me glued to the screen. The various characters kept the film interesting, and the attention to detail was truly amazing. After watching the bonus material on the disk, it's shocking to see how far the production team went to get each of the animals exactly right. From all of the individual hairs on the animals bodies, to there various mannerisms and face expressions, it really is a touch of genius, which is made Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) dramatic journey in the police force, a joy to watch. Personally, I think the movie got better once the fox, Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) was introduced to the film and I liked Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), who gave Judy hell when she first joined the force. There really is something for everyone, and judging by the profits it made at the box office, these new Disney characters went down a storm around the world. I was more impressed with the look and feel of the film, than the actually storyline but I'm sure that I will enjoy the concept more, when I watch it again. I just hope they bring these characters back to the big screen soon. Enjoyable!Round-Up: It's not very often that a movie has 3 directors but in this case, with the amount of different elements involved, I can completely understand. The first director, Byron Howard, 47, brought Bolt and Tangled to the big screen, and he also directed, the short, Tangled Ever After. Rich Moore brought Wreck-It-Ralph to the big screen, and he directed 17 episodes of the Simpson between 1990-1993 and 5 episodes of Futurama. He plans to release a sequel to Wreck-It-Ralph but that won't hit the big screen until 2018. You know how long these animation movies take to produce! Anyway, this is the first movie directed by the final director Jared Bush, and judging by the final product, they worked very well together. With John Lasseter, 59, in the production chair, the creator of Pixar, this movie is definitely one that you can watch time and time again. It currently stands as the 24th biggest movie of all time, so I would definitely say that it's worth a watch.Budget: $150million Worldwide Gross: $1BillionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, the voices by Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Bonnie Hunt and J.K.

Directing is on the spot and perfectly matched the brilliant script, which has many references to classic movies / shows / or some pop culture references, which youngest audience members probably won't be able to understand, but adults will be in nirvana watching this brilliant animation. Voice acting was also superb - there aren't superstars in every role, but that isn't a letdown, because every voice in here is brilliantly matched to the character, not the other way around. And there is a sequence with Flash - a killer scene.Overall, i do not know what other animated masterpiece should be born in the rest of 2016 that would claim Oscar for best animation in next years Oscars.

Though, after a day in the city, she learns how tough it is to strive in enforcing the law. After attempting to prove herself to her boss Chief Bogo, who doesn't believe in Hopps, she hatches a plan with mischievous fox Nick Wilde to crack a conspiracy case much bigger than themselves.Zootropolis is a stunning combination of fun and heart. It has laughs and it has drama. It's beautifully animated and carefully thought through with a story filled with adult themes as well as the usual child-friendly humour. The movie picks at a lot of the problems our world is currently suffering from, so the timing couldn't be more perfect.Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman have admirable chemistry as our misfit pair of heroes and push the story along gracefully. There are a lot of fun characters that instantly become highlights such as Flash the Sloth and Clawhauser the ZPD receptionist.

10,2017-03-05,"""Zootopia"" (for some reason known as ""Zootropolis"" in Europe) is a Disney computer animated film that takes place in a mammalian utopia in which all its animals, predatory and non-predatory, live together peacefully.A sophisticated merging of utopian science fiction with a gumshoe detective story, this relates the unlikely partnership between a pint-sized rabbit police officer and a red fox con artist as they uncover a conspiracy involving disappearing animals. It's also a hilarious movie, maybe even more so to adults than children, with one sequence that could be considered the funniest sequence ever put in an animated film.

6,2016-04-22,"Zootopia starts out as a world chock full of anthropomorphic animals that go about their lives like ordinary humans, and, thankfully, the story told within that world is nearly as intelligent as the animals that populate it. Also fortunate is the incredible way that the animals begin to feel like human characters walking about the screen; their characters are so real that it is easy to forget that they are animals.This case could be made with many movies that use anthropomorphics, but not only does Zootopia do it especially well, it also plays a clever twist -- not all the animals are civilized! Interestingly, the human race is the same way; many of our own behave like animals inside whilst appearing as human on the out. These are animals, but free animals, not ones in a normal ""zoo"", and are expected to rise above the oppressive nature humans experience along with freedom. All personas displayed in Zootopia revolve around this idea, one reason Zootopia is thoroughly captivating.Like any good story, these themes are woven through the movements of said personae, one of whom is the principal character, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin, Walk the Line), an eccentric rabbit that dreams of being a cop. Hopps has the motto anyone can be anything, and she uses this to motivate herself to become a cop. Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman, Horrible Bosses), a fox reluctant to fight for justice after being pegged as a scandalous cheater all his life, must join together to solve a mystery while fighting an uphill battle against the ""speciesist"" Chief Bogo (Idris Elba, Prometheus) of the police department and the clueless Mayor Lionheart (J.K. Simmons, Spider- Man), both of whom Hopps works for.Concerning Chief Bogo, any and all actions of his speciesism that occur within the film can easily relate to the racism that happens among humans today. Of course, he still isn't actually the villain; he's not even villainous. He's more of an obstacle that Hopps has to overcome. Bogo's intentions are good. It makes sense that a small bunny shouldn't be able to be a cop. But when he is only holding her back because she is a bunny, that's speciesism. The cynical Nick says ""You can only be what you are. Sly fox. Dumb bunny."" These types of speciesism in the film are almost identical to the racism or stereotypical boxes that we as human beings put each other into, making Zootopia all too real.Plus, the world of Zootopia is still entirely realistic, despite being animated and not live action! Characters have PB+J cell service on Carrot phones, with songs on them sung by the likes of The Beagles. Zootopia is gorgeous, and if the character and set design weren't enough the details supporting them are as in depth as they are in our universe. Every stone, every rain drop, every popsicle stick is painted perfectly, transcending the norm for animation.As technology continues to grow, the animation will obviously get better along with it, illustrated by the progression between landmark films like Snow White and Toy Story. Zootopia proves technology is getting closer and closer to making that next landmark film. Even characters moving in the background offer to the scene exactly what they need to, something so often missing in animation and as frequently in live action. Zootopia stands as some of the most technically masterful material out there, surpassed only by all of Pixar's productions, particularly their most recent effort, The Good Dinosaur.Like Dinosaur, however, Zootopia doesn't have a perfect story. Several times it becomes annoyingly predictable, and even worse, disappointing because of many cool points spoiled in the trailer. The political statements it makes are intriguing, but they begin to overshadow the story, becoming the focus of the narrative, even though such things should be displayed in the background and be representative of a magnificent story. Furthermore, just Like the political aspect, Nick Wilde takes over the story; the fox would have done better as the protagonist, boasting a dynamic character with more depth than Judy Hopps.Fortunately, the writers built in hilarity and a fast pace atoning for the weaknesses of the film, keeping witty remarks and pop culture references always right around the corner. The Godfather, Frozen, and best of all, Finding Nemo, are either referenced or spoofed in great fun. However hilarious Zootopia is, though, it's icing on the cake (albeit a cake lacking emotional ingredients) to the thoughts that it provokes about society today. ""Anyone can be anything"", and that makes sense in the world of Zootopia and on Earth.A small, apparently meek rabbit can become a cop if she works for it, even though it may be easier for a larger, more intimidating ox. Similarly, a predator isn't necessarily going to hurt you even though other predators might. That's not to say predators aren't dangerous, if they choose to be, because they can be! They have sharp teeth or long claws that can kill in seconds, but some of those predators choose not to kill. Why? The same reason that being a Muslim doesn't correlate to being a terrorist. Adults will watch and enjoy Zootopia because of its intense philosophical meanderings. Kids will fall in love with the precisely designed and adorable characters. Although all demographics will realize the lack of emotions and flawless stories Disney sometimes produces, everyone will undoubtedly fall helplessly in love with the visuals, quick pace, and the vast and uncompromising world of Zootopia.C: While lacking emotional value, Zootopia still boasts hilarity and an underlying message that applies to everyone.",925,en,zootopia start world chock full anthropomorphic animal go life like ordinary human thankfully story told within world nearly intelligent animal populate also fortunate incredible way animal begin feel like human character walking screen character real easy forget animal case could made many movie use anthropomorphics zootopia especially well also play clever twist animal civilized interestingly human race way many behave like animal inside whilst appearing human animal free animal one normal zoo expected rise oppressive nature human experience along freedom persona displayed zootopia revolve around idea one reason zootopia thoroughly captivating like good story theme woven movement said persona one principal character judy hopps ginnifer goodwin walk line eccentric rabbit dream cop hopps motto anyone anything us motivate become cop nick wilde jason bateman horrible boss fox reluctant fight justice pegged scandalous cheater life must join together solve mystery fighting uphill battle speciesist chief bogo idris elba prometheus police department clueless mayor lionheart j k simmons spider man hopps work concerning chief bogo action speciesism occur within film easily relate racism happens among human today course still actually villain even villainous obstacle hopps overcome bogo intention good make sense small bunny able cop holding back bunny speciesism cynical nick say sly fox dumb bunny type speciesism film almost identical racism stereotypical box human being put making zootopia real plus world zootopia still entirely realistic despite animated live action character pb j cell service carrot phone song sung like beagle zootopia gorgeous character set design enough detail supporting depth universe every stone every rain drop every popsicle stick painted perfectly transcending norm animation technology continues grow animation obviously get better along illustrated progression landmark film like snow white toy story zootopia prof technology getting closer closer making next landmark film even character moving background offer scene exactly need something often missing animation frequently live action zootopia stand technically masterful material surpassed pixar production particularly recent effort good dinosaur like dinosaur however zootopia perfect story several time becomes annoyingly predictable even worse disappointing many cool point spoiled trailer political statement make intriguing begin overshadow story becoming focus narrative even though thing displayed background representative magnificent story furthermore like political aspect nick wilde take story fox would done better protagonist boasting dynamic character depth judy hopps fortunately writer built hilarity fast pace atoning weakness film keeping witty remark pop culture reference always right around corner godfather frozen best finding nemo either referenced spoofed great fun however hilarious zootopia though icing cake albeit cake lacking emotional ingredient thought provokes society today anyone anything make sense world zootopia earth small apparently meek rabbit become cop work even though may easier larger intimidating ox similarly predator necessarily going hurt even though predator might say predator dangerous choose sharp teeth long claw kill second predator choose kill reason muslim correlate terrorist adult watch enjoy zootopia intense philosophical meanderings kid fall love precisely designed adorable character although demographic realize lack emotion flawless story disney sometimes produce everyone undoubtedly fall helplessly love visuals quick pace vast uncompromising world zootopia c lacking emotional value zootopia still boast hilarity underlying message applies everyone,2016-04,512,2.5731929735663477
10,2016-05-12,"Disney's Zootopia is the kind of animated film that passes with flying colors in just about every damn category it needs to, making it a thoroughly endearing classic that will stand the test of time and delight countless new fans as time goes on. It's the best of its kind since last year's Inside Out, and one that will be hard to top this time around. It's got the most treasurable kind of story, one that has all the fun, flash and zip that the kids will take a shine to, some hilariously subversive and cheeky humour for the the adults to chuckle at, and some vital, important messages within its themes that adults will knowingly relate to, and the kids will subconsciously perceive. Never preachy nor pandering, all of its ingredients are mixed harmoniously. And let's talk about that animation, good lord. Every year these films get more cutting edge and eye boggling, and this one busts the blueprints in its attempts to dazzle, with every kind of texture, glint and rendered gold on display. Animals of all shapes and sizes run, scamper, dart and dive throughout the film, to the point where I felt that only with multiple viewings could I appreciate every loving detail and subtle joke. Ginnifer Goodwin gives perky vocals to Judy Hops, a small town bunny who dreams of being a big city cop. Just leagues away from the tiny carrot farm she was raised on lies Zootopia, a sprawling metropolis where the denizens of the animal kingdom live in civilization, or rather, their brilliantly realized version of it. She is told time and time again that she'll never become a cop, but pays no heed. And whadd'ya know, she becomes a cop. Left to rot on parking duty by stern bison Sergeant Bogo (growly Idris Elba) she fumes and longs for real action. Soon she meets wily fox and street hustler Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman in possibly the best vocal performance in years), and both are whisked away on an adventure through Zootopia to find some bad cats (and every other creature imaginable) who are up to no good. The city itself is a marvel in every sense of the word. Divided into detailed, vast and climatized zones including Tundra Town, Little Rodentia (laughed hardest at this sequence, purely inspired) and a subtropical tree house lined Rainforest area. The cast has buckets of fun, including JK Simmons as Mayor Lionheart, Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake as Judy's endearing parents, Tommy Chong as a yak hippie, Peter Mansbridge as Peter 'Moosebridge', and more. Shakira shows up essentially as herself in animal form, with an original composition called 'Try Everything' which gives the film a lot of its charm and heart. Bateman just has to be commended for a performance so full of real conflict and shades of grey its hard to believe hes playing a fox in a Disney flick. Despite being in the most hyper real of all genres, hes walked right out of real life and nails every note. There's so many highlights I could write for pages, but I won't spoil the fun, of which there's no end. There's also a very grounded head on the film's shoulders, saying some important things about not giving up on your dreams (sounds clichéd, I know, but not the way the writing addresses it here), and never assuming one thing about a specific group of animals just because of the way a few of them behave. Subversive stuff for a kids movie, and I'd have it no other way, as the undercurrents of film forge minds and opinions for the young ones. Simply put, it's destined to be a classic, and comes up a winner no matter how you look at it.

The anthropomorphic animals of Zootopia are among the most lovable creatures ever created.Main character Judy Hopps is the first bunny cop in town and she is not taken seriously by her colleagues.

And it was. Kind of. It had all of the elements- the odd couple duo, the social themes and let's not forget the breathtaking animation(and by God, it was beautiful).However, there was something missing.It seemed that Disney phoned it in this time, I could see every plot point coming a mile away. It was predictable, rushed(typically Disney leaves little jokes hidden in the background, and despite the clever layout of the city, that was lacking.

9,2016-06-11,"For a studio that in modern times has taken a lot of flak for past racist cartoon depictions, Disney has come a long way with ""Zootopia."" It's as though someone at the Mouse House must have off-handedly said how great would it be if they could make a kids' movie about racism and classism and one if not all seven writers with story credits on ""Zootopia"" raised their hands and said ""challenge accepted.""Indeed, the CGI-era non-Pixar team at Disney has done just that, hitting its stride big time after ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Frozen."" (This critic has regrettably yet to see ""Big Hero 6."") ""Zootopia"" has all the best trappings of an entertaining animated family film with ample wit and heart.Yet while most animated films featuring talking animals simply for marketing purposes, the writing team (again, too many names to name here) offers an explanation of sorts. Much like 2012's ""Wreck-It Ralph"" built an entire film around video game characters existing beyond the screen, ""Zooptopia"" — which borrows all four writers from ""Ralph,"" including its director (Rich Moore) —crafts a world in which animals have evolved beyond survival instincts (and humans don't exist) and try to live together in harmony. By turning species characteristics into stereotypes and creating a predator-prey distinction, Disney lays the groundwork for an incredibly socially relevant movie.""Zootopia"" follows Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny who has aspired for her entire life to become a police officer in the mammal metropolis of Zootopia despite everyone telling her she's supposed to be a carrot farmer. But the story isn't so cliché that it results in some ""anyone can be anything"" tale. It goes well beyond, testing Judy's idealism and can-do spirit after she meets sly fox Nick (Jason Bateman) and starts to investigate a missing mammals case.The references to race and class are not subtle, and they go beyond serving as accompanying themes to movie. While kids will certainly not pick up on all of them, the filmmakers' intent is clearly to draw on examples of racism and prejudice from our world and introduce them in ways that kids can grapple with. There are elements of mystery and themes of friendship and believing in yourself, but ""Zootopia"" stands out for making this concerted effort to highlight divisions and differences and how they do not define us.The seriousness of this subject matter does not subvert the kid-friendly tone of the film, however. There's definitely a certain maturity to it (and even some scary moments), but the creative team has put together a colorful, vibrant world with various amusing characters and silly moments.Yet it's heart that really elevates ""Zootopia."" The big issues and themes allow it to go into somewhat uncharted animated territory, but also the characters of Judy and Nick are thoughtfully constructed. Judy is perhaps the perfect heroine and her journey is so incredibly sincere; Nick has the potential to be a bit more of an archetype, but he has many complex shades that help convey this notion that no character can be put in a box. The story really goes out of its way to make that point too.""Zootopia"" isn't George Orwell's ""Animal Farm,"" but it might be the most socially conscious and intelligent offering in the 20 years of this CGI era. The fact that kids and adults should enjoy it equally only makes it the more impressive. While Pixar has the clout, look at the last five years and Disney Animation's body of work is more impressive (and without any sequels).

Worse still, the story collapses when a typical cheap/easy element is added in, to resolve the build up. It's as if the screenwriters spend all their effort and wit building a story up (easy), and have none at all left when it comes to resolving to a satisfactory conclusion (always the hard part).On the positive side, the tone of the movie is cheerful, with great artwork and visuals.",152,en,zootopia summary tell story character whose ambition fit well world life sound clich would right movie also take heavy task delivering message around racism acceptance fear different unfortunately movie delivers story line depth impact message protagonist optimism resilience justified everyone depicted pushing dream including parent worse still story collapse typical cheap easy element added resolve build screenwriter spend effort wit building story easy none left come resolving satisfactory conclusion always hard part positive side tone movie cheerful great artwork visuals,2016-05,80,2.9527599369551973

The characters, especially Judy Hopps, are absolutely great! You can't help but love them, and viewers of all ages will certainly be able to relate. This is a movie which can be viewed by any, and enjoyed by any. I believe it will go down as one of the best to date, and I am quite confident that there will be plenty more in this series. I will go as far as saying that Judy Hopps will become a great addition to Disney as a whole. Her creation is absolute genius. Without spoiling anything, I will say this, you will leave the theater feeling pure joy. And might I say, surprised to some extent. The story is written beautifully and engages the viewer more than any animation I've seen within the past few years or so. This is most certainly the best animation of 2016 yet. Disney has done it again, and believe me, this is going to be a big one. Please give it a watch because you will love it. Don't let your age stop you, this is a fantastic movie for anyone of all ages and proves yet again, Disney is one of the best studios in the business when it comes to producing films that everyone can enjoy and relate to. Zootopia gets a 10 out of 10 in my book. And I feel absolutely confident saying such, and believe me, that's a rating that I do not give very easily at all. But this one deserves it.

I was surprised because I had left my monitor in my regular (for internet/text) dim/dull setting and I thought I had enabled the 'movie' mode where it spruces things up. I enabled that too, and boy was I in for a treat.The main character is a rabbit who wants to be a cop in a world where the cops are all the large animals, and she would become the first ever rabbit to become a cop. And the story is about the unusual alliance she forges with a wily fox to help her in her adventures in zootopia.The voice actress is Ginnifer Goodwin (Big Love). I remember her positivity and big heartedness from then. And that is what you get here too. A lot of the mannerisms of the rabbit they have taken from Ginnifer. And the rabbit itself is sooo gorgeously beautiful. She had the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen in my life!Zootopia - They have really gone out and developed a whole world for this movie. You keep seeing tiny tiny surprises all the time. The attention to detail is fantastic.Though there was one thing (sort of like the elephant in the room), that they really avoided.

8,2016-05-04,"As expected from an animated picture of Disney's caliber, I like it a lot. The animation and the different settings they showed throughout the movie were amazing; the chemistry between Judy and Nick was interesting enough. The anthropomorphic characters are entertaining because they're relatable and the film balances the human elements with the whole ""animal world"" very well. I think that's where the film shines the most and hence the high reviews it's getting. Usually for Disney films (and even Pixar) they only focus on one aspect; human condition or a fantasy premise. So you can say Zootopia is sort of breaking new ground by trying to do both. The only comparison I can think of that tries to match what Zootopia is doing is Pixar's Monsters Inc.Of course, like most good Disney pictures where it can be appreciated by both kids and adults alike; but through other reasons, Zootopia's brilliance lies in the important message that the film offers. It's straight-forward since aspects of it such as the ""under-dog"" story is something you see in a lot of animated movies. However, I liked how the plot manages to develop beyond that into a/the bigger picture.My only criticisms about the movie is the humor might not cut through enough to people as it's mostly witty banter and subversive. Besides that, I think a film like Zootopia, it would work MUCH BETTER as a Pixar film rather than a Disney film.Pixar films like Inside Out and Wall-E manages to deal with important themes more intelligently than Disney films like Zootopia while at the same time making the film entertaining to watch as an animation. I'm not saying those 2 films are necessarily better than Zootopia; but I'm saying they (Pixar) handle the aspect of trying to get a real-life applicable point across better. Personally for me, I prefer it when the film doesn't info-dump you with stale exposition especially if it's within one scene and keep the subtext conveying subtle across the whole picture. It might sound contradictory to what my main point is compared to the end of my opening paragraph since relating to that, I know the film-makers were trying to mesh out both a dazzling and subversive animated flick but the 2nd half of the film greatly focuses on the latter aspect. So my first impression when I was watching the ending was it tried to ""hammer in"" too much on the human subtext and should've mix it up with the fun animated stuff like in the middle parts of the film. To sum up what I'm saying, the tone of the climax (of the film) could've been handled a bit better so that way Zootopia's themes can be addressed as a wider scope for an enhancing experience.Overall, this film is on my top 10 list of my favourite animated movies and I enjoyed the technical merits more than my own personal enjoyment of the film since the humour didn't strike me that well at times. And to be honest, the funniest scene in Zootopia was already shown in the preview trailers (which I saw prior). I still found it hilarious the second time when watching the actual movie. So maybe that's actually a compliment to the execution of the film's humour despite what I said otherwise earlier?Zootopia is quite possibly the best Disney movie of the last decade since The Lion King.",565,en,expected animated picture disney caliber like lot animation different setting showed throughout movie amazing chemistry judy nick interesting enough anthropomorphic character entertaining relatable film balance human element whole animal world well think film shine hence high review getting usually disney film even pixar focus one aspect human condition fantasy premise say zootopia sort breaking new ground trying comparison think try match zootopia pixar monster inc course like good disney picture appreciated kid adult alike reason zootopia brilliance lie important message film offer straight forward since aspect dog story something see lot animated movie however liked plot manages develop beyond bigger picture criticism movie humor might cut enough people mostly witty banter subversive besides think film like zootopia would work much better pixar film rather disney film pixar film like inside wall e manages deal important theme intelligently disney film like zootopia time making film entertaining watch animation saying film necessarily better zootopia saying pixar handle aspect trying get real life applicable point across better personally prefer film info dump stale exposition especially within one scene keep subtext conveying subtle across whole picture might sound contradictory main point compared end opening paragraph since relating know film maker trying mesh dazzling subversive animated flick nd half film greatly focus latter aspect first impression watching ending tried hammer much human subtext mix fun animated stuff like middle part film sum saying tone climax film could handled bit better way zootopia theme addressed wider scope enhancing experience overall film top list favourite animated movie enjoyed technical merit personal enjoyment film since humour strike well time honest funniest scene zootopia already shown preview trailer saw prior still found hilarious second time watching actual movie maybe actually compliment execution film humour despite said otherwise earlier zootopia quite possibly best disney movie last decade since lion king,2016-05,300,2.383376739241307

8,2016-05-23,"The litmus test to confirm art and disconfirm zero-calorie entertainment is a comparison between the elements that can be found in both. There's a moment, early in Zootopia, in which our heroine is making a pop-song-backed montage-trip to her destination; the kind of scene that would otherwise typify hollowheaded Furious-7/Rom-Com style movies--yet how does Zootopia leave that sequence feeling closer to Potemkin than Pootie Tang? The montage cuts between establishing shots that are traveling closer to the center of Zootopia, but a crucial difference between this and the Cliché is, one visual element is shared by all subsequent shots; the Heroine's Vessel. The train defines the narrative purpose of each shot as taking the hero closer to their destination, instead of just showing how the second unit had virtual cameras running everywhere along the way to the city. The train will also turn out to be part of a Chekhov's armory for a resolution later in the movie.The plot of the movie, once you untangle the Noirish vines it wraps itself in, is a plucky young bunny heroine becomes a cop and flies to the Big City with a buoying air of idealism under her wings; she's here to Change the World. Make it a better place than she thinks it is. It's worse. She'll meet a shifty fox who'll challenge and disillusion her as much she'll amuse and enamor him. They'll earn from each other a reciprocal respect and more, and together, they'll make an indomitable, unlikely duo. It's the plot of a thousand movies, The Silence of the Lambs is the best of the kilo, and Zootopia runs a few paces behind it.The animation in the film is great enough to meet the greatest expectations, with an added layer most of the time missing; the characters are allowed to have nonverbal (and we guess off-screen) dramatic reactions to the proceedings, and every revisiting of the feature deepens them farther; they have an existence of their own, and aren't just saying their dialogue because wisecracks would be funny in a family movie. They own their platitudes. A rare feat. One aspect I loved even further is the Rainforest District, a rain-beaten Neo-noir Verde-vista which the characters unwisely visit and are met with a feline misadventure. It's a bold step for an animated/otherwise-Disney film to have a section in its World that isn't colored like fruit drops...and has fierce Carnivora that leap at us to equalize our interspecific excitements.Most of the humor in the movie is generic; it's all the usual high-speed-chase falling-from-a-bridge humor that drew its last laughs in the 90s. By now it should be plagiarism. Yet, because it's character-centered here, and the movie lets us warm to its characters, it's like a friend telling you an old joke, you laugh not because it's funny again, but you're glad you're having the time together.There is a substantial flaw however. The narrative bears an over-reliance on off-screen events and obscurant camera placement; the only way the screenplay knows how to resolve an urgency is pulling a resolvent carrot out of a hat; you didn't see us hide this! It wears itself into contrivance. There's also an overstatement of visual information using reiterative flashbacks. Kids should use their memories even at the movies.One of the few scenes that have wrought the teaspoonful of half-negative reviews the film has gotten is the Sloth sequence at a DMV office. If the movie is against stereotyping, then oh, why are all the sloths with jobs and speaking roles in it lethargic, as if constrained by their biological limitations even in a family film? Those who complain about this scene didn't stay for the epilogue to see the setup subverted. It's what marks the difference between good satire and generic parody; satire sets up the tropes again within its own story's context to demolish them with focus, yet parody just gobbles up the setups made in other works and belches lazy punchlines. The sloth sequence was necessary to prove a counterpoint, instead of simply stating one.""We may be evolved, but deep down, we're still Animales.."" so observes a Mr. Big in the film. He's paraphrasing a compagno of his, from an earlier version of himself, who said about black folks, ""They're Animals anyway. So let them lose their souls."" Of course, his compagno, in spite of being a Sabre-toothed ligature-toting predator, excluded himself from the Animales subcategory; he didn't even presume to be the gamekeeper. I know, I'm annoying you, comparing a 'kiddie movie' to a god-daddie movie, but one thing the confronto illustrates, even the dimmest film characters are evolving, at least on the top shelf of the art form.In this era where movies are blighted by on-the-nose dialogue (even very good ones like Interstellar) and fortune-cookie messages, sometimes with very sour fortune cookies, we seldom open the valves of our hearts to them.A lifetime's worth of product-line-assembled mediocrities has given us constrictive pericarditis.Zootopia is like a pericardiectomy that peels away that hardened pericardium, and lets our hearts expand with joy again...if only for 108 minutes and 32 seconds. Until we walk out of the screening and are assaulted by the Batman v Superman posters outstaying their welcome on the cinema walls, that fill our ventricles with venom again; not a result of the counterfeit product they're marketing being powerful enough, or powerful at all, to make us feel anything by itself; all it does and can do is steer backwards (and blindly) from every paragraph in this review. No half-good movie would ever do that.I love movies more than most things (anything?), but, I prefer to hate them; it's much more fun to frame-by-frame them, and deconstruct their technique than to futilely mine them for oft-nonexistent Deeper Meaning. Zootopia earns a high grade on both levels; it's the rare big movie you actually root for at the movies.8/10",976,en,litmus test confirm art disconfirm zero calorie entertainment comparison element found moment early zootopia heroine making pop song backed montage trip destination kind scene would otherwise typify hollowheaded furious rom com style movie yet zootopia leave sequence feeling closer potemkin pootie tang montage cut establishing shot traveling closer center zootopia crucial difference clich one visual element shared subsequent shot heroine vessel train defines narrative purpose shot taking hero closer destination instead showing second unit virtual camera running everywhere along way city train also turn part chekhov armory resolution later movie plot movie untangle noirish vine wrap plucky young bunny heroine becomes cop fly big city buoying air idealism wing change world make better place think worse meet shifty fox challenge disillusion much amuse enamor earn reciprocal respect together make indomitable unlikely duo plot thousand movie silence lamb best kilo zootopia run pace behind animation film great enough meet greatest expectation added layer time missing character allowed nonverbal guess screen dramatic reaction proceeding every revisiting feature deepens farther existence saying dialogue wisecrack would funny family movie platitude rare feat one aspect loved even rainforest district rain beaten neo noir verde vista character unwisely visit met feline misadventure bold step animated otherwise disney film section world colored like fruit drop fierce carnivora leap u equalize interspecific excitement humor movie generic usual high speed chase falling bridge humor drew last laugh plagiarism yet character centered movie let u warm character like friend telling old joke laugh funny glad time together substantial flaw however narrative bear reliance screen event obscurant camera placement way screenplay know resolve urgency pulling resolvent carrot hat see u hide wear contrivance also overstatement visual information using reiterative flashback kid use memory even movie one scene wrought teaspoonful half negative review film gotten sloth sequence dmv office movie stereotyping oh sloth job speaking role lethargic constrained biological limitation even family film complain scene stay epilogue see setup subverted mark difference good satire generic parody satire set trope within story context demolish focus yet parody gobble setup made work belch lazy punchlines sloth sequence necessary prove counterpoint instead simply stating one may evolved deep still animales observes mr big film paraphrasing compagno earlier version said black folk animal anyway let lose soul course compagno spite sabre toothed ligature toting predator excluded animales subcategory even presume gamekeeper know annoying comparing kiddie movie god daddie movie one thing confronto illustrates even dimmest film character evolving least top shelf art form era movie blighted nose dialogue even good one like interstellar fortune cookie message sometimes sour fortune cooky seldom open valve heart lifetime worth product line assembled mediocrity given u constrictive pericarditis zootopia like pericardiectomy peel away hardened pericardium let heart expand joy minute second walk screening assaulted batman v superman poster outstaying welcome cinema wall fill ventricle venom result counterfeit product marketing powerful enough powerful make u feel anything steer backwards blindly every paragraph review half good movie would ever love movie thing anything prefer hate much fun frame frame deconstruct technique futilely mine oft nonexistent deeper meaning zootopia earns high grade level rare big movie actually root movie,2016-05,516,2.735588505278713

7,2019-12-25,"Zootopia is the latest Disney animated film from their own animation studio. From seeing the advertising for the film I had no ambition to see this movie in the slightest. However, after seeing the positive reviews and the praise the film has been getting from people I decided to give it a look finally. I have to say this is probably the most mature animated film from Disney since the Incredibles, which is saying a great deal.Now, I thought I was in trouble with this film at the very beginning. Honestly, the first fifteen to twenty minutes is my biggest grip with the movie. You have Hopps dreaming of being a police officer and everyone else putting her down saying it's impossible, even her own parents, and she has to prove her worth. It's a theme that's been done to death in movies, especially kids movies. It's not even especially bad in its execution, but it's just very heavy-handed and formulaic.Fortunately, once we get past those first twenty minutes and we get into the mystery angle of the movie it gets much better. The mystery angle is easily the pest part of this film. The whole ""don't judge a book by its cover"" theme is still present but I think it's handled in a much better way. It even goes to a place that I did not expect a film like this to go. Though, they do kind of go back on it by the end I was still amazed they went there at all.The second best thing is the characters. I really do like the two leads, Hopps and Wild. Wild is my favorite character definitely. The side characters are also a lot of fun.The animation is on-point, as well as the voice acting. Every voice fit their respective character perfectly. The action is also quite well-done and engaging. I also loved the artwork, especially of the city itself. The humor is also quite good. There were some jokes that were typical but most hit. There was this one scene where they straight-up parodied The Godfather and it was hilarious. It was the funniest thing in the entire flick.I also loved the design of Zootopia and its various sectors it has. The colors are so vibrant and the animation is great. From that to the people and their interactions with each other really brings this city alive and makes it feel like a real city.Overall, Zootopia is the best animated film from Disney since Frozen. It has a great cast of characters, a great mystery, great action, great art and animation, and a good portrayal of its many themes, adult themes, even if it felt fisted at times. I think this definitely a great film for the entire family.",460,en,zootopia latest disney animated film animation studio seeing advertising film ambition see movie slightest however seeing positive review praise film getting people decided give look finally say probably mature animated film disney since incredibles saying great deal thought trouble film beginning honestly first fifteen twenty minute biggest grip movie hopps dreaming police officer everyone else putting saying impossible even parent prove worth theme done death movie especially kid movie even especially bad execution heavy handed formulaic fortunately get past first twenty minute get mystery angle movie get much better mystery angle easily pest part film whole judge book cover theme still present think handled much better way even go place expect film like go though kind go back end still amazed went second best thing character really like two lead hopps wild wild favorite character definitely side character also lot fun animation point well voice acting every voice fit respective character perfectly action also quite well done engaging also loved artwork especially city humor also quite good joke typical hit one scene straight parodied godfather hilarious funniest thing entire flick also loved design zootopia various sector color vibrant animation great people interaction really brings city alive make feel like real city overall zootopia best animated film disney since frozen great cast character great mystery great action great art animation good portrayal many theme adult theme even felt fisted time think definitely great film entire family,2019-12,235,2.9725403985290018

I will spare the details, but her journey involves a detailed crime investigation in tandem with a sly fox. The story is not entirely predictable and moves at a decent pace to keep the viewer engaged. I like that the movie encompasses various movie genres, which is characteristic of an excellent animated movie. Music is average, but can safely be overlooked.The most impressive parts are the commentary on various social issues as well as the small details that are paid close attention to. The characteristics of each animal was clearly studied well, and there were no logical discontinuities with the facts.

The costume and likeness to real relationships especially father- daughter were light-hearted and heart warming. Following the character introduction, action adventure was quickly eased into with help from the music. Defying convention was a quickly woven-in feature of the film with the main characters choices quickly going against the norm. This really acted as a great hook for future endeavours.Main bodyThe storyline was simple and clear. The plot was complex enough however to not unveil too much too early keeping me guessing throughout the film. In parts, the mood was a little predictable yet small flourishes of light-hearted humour, with great effects in the well created virtual world, kept me well entertained.The music continued well and the tempo of the film was fast enough for an enjoyable action, yet not confused by rushing for effect. The balance between happiness and turmoil was just right, avoiding an excessive bout of isolated trouble that some childish films typically suffer from. This made the film enjoyable for family yet not just accessible for all.The variety in the characters, their mode of speech and personality was great and helped transport me into their lives. They each had roles in fictional society and well created costumes to match these. A few well known actors were also involved in assisting their portrayal. Scene changes were dynamic and frequent to assist the films good tempo providing stimulation for the viewer.Relationships were dealt with nicely with only a hint of possible future romance. This was good since it helped the movie tone Remain in keeping with the action genre distracting the viewer or plot goal.MusicThe music was up-beat with a strong tempo and was great for the start of any happy adventure. Shakira Try everything seemed like a great choice ... As the story unfolded, the music was adjusted accordingly and appeared to fit in well with most of the scenes. The subtlety of the music in darker times made it less memorable yet left the effects no less effective.EndingThe ending was quite appropriate for an unpredictable action film. The resolution to the plot issues was not expected and therefore highly entertaining.SummaryOverall a clear story with entertaining plot quirks. It has great potential to produce a sequel. It was seriously difficult to find fault with since the created world and characters shouted as much diversity as the dynamic scene and setting locations with their stories. The film captured my imagination, transported me to another world, intellectually stimulated me with light humour and kept me thoroughly entertained with an interesting plot and storyline.

10,2016-03-31,"Zootropolis (UK) or Zootopia (US) is the new fun family Disney animated adventure that finally explains why in all animated films the animals act basically like humans. The film centers on ZPD Cop Judy Hopps who is the first rabbit police officer in Zootropolis and hopes to make the world a better place. However, when she is demoted to parking duty she meets a slick Fox hustler, who becomes the key for Judy to solve a case in the city that will prove her worthiness as a police officer.Zootropolis is a brilliant, exciting and hilarious film to see, very enjoyable for all audiences, and will make your day. It is absolutely fuelled with funny jokes that will even really tickle adults as well. It is visually stunning and so beautiful you would want to visit the animal kingdom itself. It is also supported by a great song ""Try Everything"". Like ""Everything is Awesome"" it fills me with an appreciation for life.Like any other animated film, it is filled with heartwarming messages of reaching for your dreams and believing in yourself, but also some more really grown up messages potentially trying to mirror society, such as diversity and understanding. This made the film seem really mature, creating a real impact to me as a viewer. Of course this does not make it inappropriate for children at all. I'd like to see much more animated films with depth.Although I only really got into the story by half way through, so it needs to pick up after a while. But the narrative is one of the strongest points of the film, as you will gather when you see it yourself.The problem with these films is that at the end, it puts you in such a feel good mood, you don't want it to end.

10,2016-09-04,"Zootopia is an animated buddy-cop comedy mystery film directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. The screenplay is written by Jared Bush, Phil Jonston and on the main voice-role stars Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Tommy Chong, J. K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Shakira. Zootopia is a place where all animals, prey and predator live in peace and harmony. A rabbit named Judy Hops dreams of becoming the first rabbit cop ever and on her journey to her dream she runs into a fox, named Nick Wilde. Together they will try to solve a mystery about some missing predator civilians on the city of Zootopia. I personally loved this film and its message with all my heart. I was in tears by the end of the film just because of how beautiful/creative and well done the message about living in peace and together even though we may be different in race and/or other things (e.g. religion, gender etc). The animation is incredible to look at, this movie is an undeniable visual treat every second of it. It is also very funny and references a lot of other famous movies and TV Shows (Breaking Bad). Kids will have a good time marveling at the beautiful animation and the really likable characters, but I feel like adults will be the ones to enjoy this movie the most. The message that comes across is timeless and very much necessary at this point and time. All the voice work is amazing, Ginnifer Goodwin does a fantastic job on the lead role and Jason Bateman delivered that slick fun tone throughout his likable character. The music is composed by the talented Michael Giacchino, who has been very busy recently composing pretty much every amazing soundtrack on a lot of successful movies. He also does a very good job here, with his composition that delivers what is required on certain scenes.

The fox she encounters in Zootopia is in fact someone different than what she's been familiar with before but I'm ahead of myself.

9,2016-03-05,"Usually Disney means that it lacks a certain edge or quality that makes it 'safe' or palatable for all audiences. While Zootopia is certainly another big blockbuster for the studio, and especially for the filmmakers and animators who have been behind many of the smash successes of the past 10 years (starting with Meet the Robinsons up through now, when John Lasseter took over), it's not a movie with talking animals something that is dumbed down or has a message that gets obfuscated by too much (dumb) goofball comedy (I'm looking at you, Ice Age and Madagascar sequels). This is actually about something in the same way, not quite up to this level but in the same ballpark, as Watership Down or The Fox and the Hound - though the former is certainly darker than this and the latter a little sweeter and more grounded (much as it can be) in the real world, Zootopia is an excellent example of using animals to convey a message about where we are at today.The film might eschew the current horrors of police brutality (hey, it is ultimately a movie that kids can enjoy, and that might be a lot to take in as far as an animated movie with animals), but it is really impactful about telling a good message about a complicated subject: how does the ""melting pot"" work? What happens when groups of people - or animals - converge in one city and have to interact with one another? What happens if the thing that separates the animals, acting without the human qualities (or like savage/aggressive beasts) is amplified to create tensions?And what happens when someone who doesn't fit in has the veracity and intelligence and just will-power to rise to the top of something tries to be accepted in a society where he (or in this case also primarily she) doesn't fit in? What I liked in the movie, aside from it having a very clever police procedural plot (which gets in jokes at the expense of The Godfather, which is nothing new but is done with a very funny Don Corleone parody in a tiny rat, and hippie-""nude"" yoga-ists), is that it is generally about addressing what it means to be the ""other"" in a society. It never comes outright and says ""it's about racism"" point-blank, but it shows it even in something like scale.Some animated films may not pay or draw too much attention to how animals' size differences mark then, but here it's clear from almost the beginning that how small Judy the Bunny is sets her apart from everyone when she's in the city (and likewise how she is bigger than those in the Rodent district, which is a part of Zootopia built for little mice). So it's not hard to see why she is set apart, and yet the movie is more about if you really DO try to make a difference yourself and set yourself apart, you can change things. Maybe. Or you might be looked at as a sly fox your whole life, or a slow sloth. How are you perceived in the world?Though it has a couple of story problems (a story turn two thirds of the way through, which is kind of crammed in to create conflict where it could be handled much better as far as something that separates the two main characters), it's probably my favorite of the recent run of Disney Animated Films productions. And as heavy as I'm making this movie sound it really isn't - it's bright and colorful and the filmmakers have a terrific sense of a whole world that has been built; they could've rested on just one part (the main metropolitan/granite part of the city), but there's so many parts to it that it works for so many possibilities (polar bears, panthers, wolves have their parts of the city) that are seized.It's fresh, clever but also funny, with some excellent performances (Goodwin and Bateman sure, but Elba, Slade and Simmons are very welcome additions with their own personalities), plus it's a cop procedural, and a very good one at that (with a few predictable parts, but it's this kind of movie so I can let it pass).",705,en,usually disney mean lack certain edge quality make safe palatable audience zootopia certainly another big blockbuster studio especially filmmaker animator behind many smash success past year starting meet robinson john lasseter took movie talking animal something dumbed message get obfuscated much dumb goofball comedy looking ice age madagascar sequel actually something way quite level ballpark watership fox hound though former certainly darker latter little sweeter grounded much real world zootopia excellent example using animal convey message today film might eschew current horror police brutality hey ultimately movie kid enjoy might lot take far animated movie animal really impactful telling good message complicated subject melting pot work happens group people animal converge one city interact one another happens thing separate animal acting without human quality like savage aggressive beast amplified create tension happens someone fit veracity intelligence power rise top something try accepted society case also primarily fit liked movie aside clever police procedural plot get joke expense godfather nothing new done funny corleone parody tiny rat hippie nude yoga ists generally addressing mean society never come outright say racism point blank show even something like scale animated film may pay draw much attention animal size difference mark clear almost beginning small judy bunny set apart everyone city likewise bigger rodent district part zootopia built little mouse hard see set apart yet movie really try make difference set apart change thing maybe might looked sly fox whole life slow sloth perceived world though couple story problem story turn two third way kind crammed create conflict could handled much better far something separate two main character probably favorite recent run disney animated film production heavy making movie sound really bright colorful filmmaker terrific sense whole world built could rested one part main metropolitan granite part city many part work many possibility polar bear panther wolf part city seized fresh clever also funny excellent performance goodwin bateman sure elba slade simmons welcome addition personality plus cop procedural good one predictable part kind movie let pas,2016-03,332,2.53147223425154
8,2016-02-18,"Tangled, Wreck it Ralph and now Zootopia. It looks like Disney Animation is quickly becoming a pool of great movies. I came out of this one with a smile that covered my whole face and I still find hard to shake it off, this movie blew me away in excitement, fun but most of all heart.One cannot start to talk about Zootopia without mentioning some of the best world building of recent years. other than being animated to perfection, this film is alive, it is engaging even in its background and other than being intelligently thought out, it tells a story only with its world. Be it comedy or social commentary, I just wished multiple times I could put it pause the film or instantly rewatch a scene to absorb everything that was going on. This is a further example of the truly excellent, intelligent visual storytelling animated films are excelling at, especially recently and I remember clearly having a moment in the film in which I was effortlessly happy for cinema and its future, because this was the living proof of correctly using new mediums and technologies to tell a story.And I haven't even started yet talking about the characters of Zootopia. As I was watching the film I thought to myself that these were going to become staples of the genre, that's how good they are. The chemistry between the two main characters is unbelievable and their arch is riveting to watch at every moment, with a fantastic pay off. This film is so well written: be it the running gags, the pop culture references which never end and never miss, the character development, the storytelling, the themes incorporated seamlessly, the emotional connection, the perfect handling of secondary characters, the hilarious, laugh out loud comedic moments, I hope I am not missing anything, all of these were part of screenplay that I am sure I will revisit and study joyfully. I can't believe how much I fell in love with this world and its characters and only now I realized how entertained I was with them, not to mention how absorbing the story proved to be.The film does have its false steps, but none of them really mattered to me. The introduction is somewhat off beat and uneven with the rest, there are a little too many coincidences and whilst the characters are thankfully in danger many times, they are as many times handed a solution to problems which makes things a little too easy for them at times, yet fortunately the film does integrate these very organically to the point were you roll along, without even thinking about it.I wished this film would not end, that's how much fun I was having with it, this is a very recommended watch in the theater, where possibly adults are going to have more fun than kids.

8,2016-06-04,"This beautiful animation came to exist because of coming together of the directors of 'Tangled' and 'Wreck-it-Ralp'. It is Disney who had once again done it, since their rival Pixer is going down in a rapid speed. As a Disney fan since my childhood, I'm very happy for their success in live-shot films and animations, especially for this one.Okay, since the revolution of 3D animation over 20 years ago after overthrowing the 2D animation, most of the big productions like Disney, Pixer and Dreamworks with few others never failed to deliver. Believe me, I was not interested in this film when I first saw the teaser and trailer. But they have done great promotions and so the film did awesomely at screens worldwide. I was totally blown away after seeing it, Disney's another unique universal charactered story. From the little children to the grown ups, everybody definitely going to enjoy it.All kinds of animals coming together happens only in cinemas, and that too mostly in animations. But todays kids are very sharp who ask lots of questions, so they had a fine explanation for the doubts regarding putting animals in a same society. It was like the United States, where everyone came from different continents and represents different race. And so in this film every animal came from different land to live together peacefully in a city called Zootopia.So the story begins when Judy the rabbit follows her dream to become a police officer in Zootopia. There she meets Nick the fox, who are actually arch-rival species in the wild, but it was thousands of years ago before adapting the civilisation. So trust is what not promised between them, but they're forced to work together after a small missing person case becomes their prime agenda. Solving the mystery is what brings the end to this wonderful tale.These days animations are not just concentrated on comedies, trying to get us emotionally as well. Maybe that's how they're grabbing the adult audience, especially the families. Shakira's cameo was the highlight, and her song 'Try Everything' helped the get attention from all the corners.The Oscars was concluded just a couple of months ago, but it already feels like the fever is gripping again for the next edition and looks like this film is leading the way for the animation category. I know it's too early, but I hope it wins it.

8,2016-06-04,"There has never been a dearth in good animated movies especially the ones catered to young audience and Zootopia makes no exception. Beneath its charming lead characters, kids friendly action and comedy, an interesting plot and top notch animation lies the premise which is designed to be too metaphorically equivalent to current society which I think could be the only downside to this entertaining romp. Any standard stereotype tag you name it, you got it here - underdog, buddy cop, judgmental society, prejudice, beyond all odds, **spoiler alert** projected-good-character-is-the-villain etc.It is a world where animals of all species have evolved to shed their natural instinct and live harmoniously in the same society. Judy Hopps (voice by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a feisty young bunny from a small town who is determined to become the first bunny cop in Zootopia. Despite the prejudice and the physical limitation, she successfully enrolls and completes the Police training with top honors through sheer hard work and wit. When a sensational case of 13 missing mammals breaks the headlines, the Police Chief Bogo (voice by Idris Elba) overlooks Hopps and assigns her the traffic duty. Her judgmental view on fox species lets her catch a petty thief Nick Wilde (voice by Jason Bateman) a stumble upon a lead on the missing mammals. Clearing obstacle after obstacle she uncovers the abduction of all the missing mammals that points the Mayor Lionheart (voice by J.K. Simmons) as the chief accused. But is it the end of investigation?There are many aspects that contributes to a good movie or story, either some more aspects or bettering the existing ones make them great. But the level of audience connect with the story makes them a classic. Zootopia falls short of the classic level but has everything to make it great. First and foremost, is the story interesting and entertaining? Full marks for that. Are you able to relate to setup and get involved in its plot? Sure. A lead character that you would want to root for, a wily fox that breaks your stereotype, a supremely entertaining Godfather- esque episode, a ROFL worthy extended sequence involving a sloth, a nude sequence that jumps on you, a thrilling chase through the rodent town and many more. It also has a moral on not crossing a limit to get even - which is very important for young viewers.Despite its familiar premise, generous use of stereotypes and pop culture references and a Scooby-Doo style plot - there is a maturity and skilled handling of some sequences which results in winning moments and that's exactly what makes a movie successful. On top of its beautiful animation it is complemented by excellent voice performances and minimal and apt use of background score.Relevant to a fault and gives an important lesson to its young and adult viewers alike bundled in an entertaining package.",476,en,never dearth good animated movie especially one catered young audience zootopia make exception beneath charming lead character kid friendly action comedy interesting plot top notch animation lie premise designed metaphorically equivalent current society think could downside entertaining romp standard stereotype tag name got underdog buddy cop judgmental society prejudice beyond odds spoiler alert projected good character villain etc world animal specie evolved shed natural instinct live harmoniously society judy hopps voice ginnifer goodwin feisty young bunny small town determined become first bunny cop zootopia despite prejudice physical limitation successfully enrolls completes police training top honor sheer hard work wit sensational case missing mammal break headline police chief bogo voice idris elba overlook hopps assigns traffic duty judgmental view fox specie let catch petty thief nick wilde voice jason bateman stumble upon lead missing mammal clearing obstacle obstacle uncovers abduction missing mammal point mayor lionheart voice j k simmons chief accused end investigation many aspect contributes good movie story either aspect bettering existing one make great level audience connect story make classic zootopia fall short classic level everything make great first foremost story interesting entertaining full mark able relate setup get involved plot sure lead character would want root wily fox break stereotype supremely entertaining godfather esque episode rofl worthy extended sequence involving sloth nude sequence jump thrilling chase rodent town many also moral crossing limit get even important young viewer despite familiar premise generous use stereotype pop culture reference scooby doo style plot maturity skilled handling sequence result winning moment exactly make movie successful top beautiful animation complemented excellent voice performance minimal apt use background score relevant fault give important lesson young adult viewer alike bundled entertaining package,2016-06,278,2.526927871234351
7,2025-12-22,"At a business and creative level, Zootopia is one of the most efficiently designed animated films of the modern studio era.Business & IP StrategyFrom a market perspective, this is close to a perfect product by Disney. The theme is universal and scalable: kids come for the charm, teens for the detective plot, adults for the social satire. Three audiences, one film.Merchandising potential is massive - a city populated by every animal type imaginable naturally translates into toys, collectibles, costumes, and spin-offs. The city itself functions as an expandable franchise engine: each district could support its own series, game, or short.Crucially, using animals instead of humans lowers cultural risk. The film feels socially relevant without triggering direct political or cultural backlash - a key factor behind its $1B+ global box office.Genre & Production ApproachCreatively, Zootopia works as a smart genre hybrid: buddy-cop comedy, light noir mystery, and fairy-tale worldbuilding. This blend broadens appeal without alienating any demographic.The social commentary is deliberately framed through biology and instinct rather than explicit politics, allowing the film to appear thoughtful while remaining ""safe."" From a producer's standpoint, that balance is a major win.The influence of the Story Trust philosophy associated with Pixar is evident - the film feels heavily iterated, polished, and structurally precise.Direction & WorldbuildingZootopia itself is the film's strongest character. Districts like Sahara Square, Tundratown, and Little Rodentia aren't just visual gags - they establish scale, climate logic, and urban realism. The city feels functional, alive, and internally consistent.The comedic rhythm is sharp, especially in the sloth DMV sequence, which doubles as a masterclass in timing. Voice performance contrast adds texture: nervous optimism versus dry cynicism creates chemistry closer to live-action buddy films than standard animation.Screenplay: Strengths and LimitsStructurally, the script is clean and classical: aspiration, fall, investigation, moral error, escalation, resolution.The standout dramatic moment is the press conference scene, where the protagonist unintentionally reinforces the very prejudice she's fighting. Stakes rise, relationships fracture, and the story pivots organically - a textbook example of strong family-film dramaturgy.The main weakness lies in the metaphor itself. When examined deeply, biological predator/prey logic doesn't fully map onto real-world social constructs.

9,2016-03-21,"With Pixar being owned by Disney, there seems to have been a nice amount of bleed over between the two, Pixar is more consistent with the quality of their films, but every once and awhile a movie of Pixar's quality comes from Disney. We should remember that Disney was once, and in many ways still is the premiere animation company, but not that long ago they had been struggling to put out great films. Zootopia is smart, funny, and is mature in its storytelling and in its message. It's very nice to see a movie directed at kids that has respect and treats kids as people who can understand complex themes, not mindless creatures that need simple clichéd messages.In that respect Zootopia is more like a Pixar film, where Pixar has shown an understanding that complex messages can be the most emotionally powerful and while being complex can be presented in a simple, and straightforward way. Much like Inside Out taught us so much about using our emotions, especially sadness, Zootopia has a great message about fear and the treatment of entire groups of people because of that fear. It's ironic, because the movie indirectly latches onto an issue that is relevant today, with an air of innocence and purity. On top of that at a deeper level, the film is witty, in that everything ties together and that the audience is forced to think as the movie progresses.The humor is witty as well, in particular the scene about the DMV which is so funny because it's spot on. The witty humor and complex messages make this film enjoyable for everybody, not just kids. Every character in the film is given a great amount of thought and development, making it so that they all have moments to grow, and are extremely relatable. Unfortunately the film's villain has good motivations, however at the end when they reveal who the villain is they come across as campy and over the top.The movie does a great job creating an inventive world where animals from all different habitats can coexist in one city. The film then proceeds to partially waste it's inventive world on various scenes that are plucked straight out of other films, namely the Godfather. However, those scenes are only a small takeaway from the movie as a whole, because they don't last very long and are admittedly clever. That along with the overall maturity the screenwriters used still makes the film a great accomplishment.Zootopia never really looked like a film that would be this good, but after seeing the amazing amount of craft and effort, it seems this may be one of the better animated films of the year. The film does what every animated film should do, it tells a solid story with a lot of emotional depth, and a message that can hopefully teach kids important lessons. The film is also funny, smart, beautifully animated, filled with great characters, and features great voice work. If you have kids, and they haven't seen this film yet, it's safe to say they'd enjoy it, but they may possibly take an important life lesson away from seeing it to.",527,en,pixar owned disney seems nice amount bleed two pixar consistent quality film every awhile movie pixar quality come disney remember disney many way still premiere animation company long ago struggling put great film zootopia smart funny mature storytelling message nice see movie directed kid respect treat kid people understand complex theme mindless creature need simple clich message respect zootopia like pixar film pixar shown understanding complex message emotionally powerful complex presented simple straightforward way much like inside taught u much using emotion especially sadness zootopia great message fear treatment entire group people fear ironic movie indirectly latch onto issue relevant today air innocence purity top deeper level film witty everything tie together audience forced think movie progress humor witty well particular scene dmv funny spot witty humor complex message make film enjoyable everybody kid every character film given great amount thought development making moment grow extremely relatable unfortunately film villain good motivation however end reveal villain come across campy top movie great job creating inventive world animal different habitat coexist one city film proceeds partially waste inventive world various scene plucked straight film namely godfather however scene small takeaway movie whole last long admittedly clever along overall maturity screenwriter used still make film great accomplishment zootopia never really looked like film would good seeing amazing amount craft effort seems may one better animated film year film every animated film tell solid story lot emotional depth message hopefully teach kid important lesson film also funny smart beautifully animated filled great character feature great voice work kid seen film yet safe say enjoy may possibly take important life lesson away seeing,2016-03,269,2.7633612151043403
9,2016-03-11,"In 1992, cartoonist Art Spiegelman won the Pulitzer Prize for Maus, which appropriated cuddly, anthropomorphic animals (not at all unlike Disney creatures) for a parable about racism, discrimination, and survival, circa WWII. Flash-forward 24 years, and we finally have Disney's rebuttal. And those years have been good to the House of Mouse, now enough of a franchise super-giant to fire off quirky B-tier flicks like Zootopia, confident enough to surpass Disney's usual standard of impeccable visuals and emotional storytelling to also really be About Something. Zootopia is razor-sharp, outrageously clever, bustling with urgent thematic subtext, and heartfelt enough to reach the realm of Disney classics sure to be heralded as essential canonical viewing for generations of children and adults henceforth.Following (the vastly inferior) The Good Dinosaur as the second consecutive Disney release championing a thriving societal infrastructure where humans don't exist (hmm...), Zootopia is a dazzlingly dense and textured realm almost too detailed to take in at first glance, forcing cinema viewers to acclimatize to the consistent unrequited urge to pause and contemplate. When our protagonist, earnest Officer Hopps (magnificently emotive, infectiously giddy Ginnifer Goodwin), arrives at Zootopia, the film is content to momentarily become a travelogue, drinking in, in a sweeping pan shot, the regions, and size/species/climate sub-communities of the city. Don't worry, though - we'll get to revisit them all later). Before you can think of a better pun than ""face the yaks"", Zootopia has transformed into a buddy (or should I say BUNNY - I thought of one!) cop mystery adventure. As Hopps pairs with irrepressible con-fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman at his most laconic, smugly hilarious), they dive into a romp full of hilarity, exhilarating sequences (including a slew of chases/tussles highlighting the unique physicality of each animal present), and thematic mediation on xenophobia, ideology, and societal power hierarchies. Y'know - kid stuff.Zootopia isn't subtle about being just as issue-driven as story-driven, but nor should it be. Here, the parable of civilized mammals 'going savage' (an interesting contribution to the nature/nurture debate in itself) serves as the perfect catalyst to ignite age-old discriminatory tensions between tenuously co-habitating predator and prey (including some genuinely upsetting sequences), in a fashion perfectly suited to contextualize privilege, racism, and wage and influence-gaps to children - heck, even for adults. But in case that gets too heavy (and Zootopia, while jaunty and fast-paced, has its fair share of vintage Disney darkness), it's tempered with some on-point one- liners to snarkily soften the blow (""a bunny can call another bunny cute, but you can't""/""you can't just touch a sheep's wool!!""), with only the occasional clunky line reeking of kid-friendly rewrites to distract from the revelry. For the kids, there are more Frozen and other Disney nods than you can count (including a genius Alan Tudyk cameo I'll weasel out of spoiling here). For the adults: inspired nudist colony gags, and riffs on the Godfather and Breaking Bad. And yes: that sloth DMV scene is just as funny in theatres as in the umpteen trailers you've seen it in. Trust me.Still, amidst all the ideas, heart, and cutting dialogue, the voice cast are what really hit home. Apart from the superb Goodwin and Bateman, who share delightfully sparky, and sometimes surprisingly emotional banter, the distinctive boom of Idris Elba and bark of J.K. Simmons lend welcome support, while Jenny Slate mumbles so many (yup, I'm going there) sheepish witticisms in the background she's almost worth a second viewing singlehandedly.Zootopia doesn't quite hit the soaring, transcendent emotional heights associated with classic Lion King/Beauty and the Beast era Disney (though many of its smaller moments are just as poignant and well-orchestrated in their own way), as it's really its own (guffaw) animal. But, as a snappier, more expansive, socially conscious cousin, it's still an essential addition to the Disney family, and one that almost insists upon revisiting, if only to properly do justice to. Rich, vibrant, and clever enough to make audiences young and old (night)howl with laughter, Zootopia is the confident work of a peerless studio operating at the top of their game, and necessary viewing as cinema, far surpassing mere animated entertainment.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be off trying to beat that stupidly catchy Shakira chorus out of my head.

8,2016-03-06,"Wow, this one surprised me. I saw the early trailers for this movie and had extremely low expectations for this movie, expecting to just be another awful March movie. However, when I saw that it then had a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, I decided to go see it. Well, I was wrong to judge it so early just based on the trailer. This movie was absolutely brilliant. It had more to say on relevant issues than a vast majority of adult live-action movies do, and it still found a way to do so in a clever and not overbearing way. The plot, while formulaic, was still interesting and the message and humor more than made up for the relative unoriginality of the plot. The characters in this movie were also rather cliché, but the movie used that nicely to make many points about stereotyping so that can't be used as a negative. This is a must-see for both kids and adults, the best true ""family"" movie in years.",168,en,wow one surprised saw early trailer movie extremely low expectation movie expecting another awful march movie however saw rotten tomato decided go see well wrong judge early based trailer movie absolutely brilliant say relevant issue vast majority adult live action movie still found way clever overbearing way plot formulaic still interesting message humor made relative unoriginality plot character movie also rather clich movie used nicely make many point stereotyping used negative must see kid adult best true family movie year,2016-03,80,2.767396875829075
9,2016-04-08,"Best since the Lion King? Well, I don't know, I'd need to do a side-by-side comparison once it comes out on home media, but it certainly has the potential to be so.See, the problem is that, while this film is indeed good, the few times at which it blunders, it doesn't just blunder a little. It blunders big time.Think of it as being- 95% OMG THIS IS AWESOME, and 5% Oh sweet cheese and crackers, why did they do that?!!Some of the dialogue gets very painfully ham-fisted with the discrimination message, and the characters subsequently come across as tragically unaware because of it.A few of the characters, chief among them (pun not intended) being Chief Bogo, fell into this category so often that I actually thought they were being built up to be the villains (spoiler alert: they're not).Equally frustrating about the discrimination angle is that, when you step back and think about it, there actually is a lot of potential rationale behind a lot of the dialogue getting thrown around, but the movie never really explores that and instead tries to use it as a metaphor for our own prejudices (which, again, when you really think about it, they very clearly are not).The sloths at the DMV? That gets old in about five seconds, but the producers clearly thought it was comedic gold and drove it into the ground, turning what could have been an otherwise cute but forgettable gag into an absolute teeth-pulling aggravation.But that's about it for the bad stuff. These bits are liable to irk you, not because they are so bad, but because the rest of the film is excellent by comparison. Judy Hopps is an excellent protagonist, easily the best female lead character Disney has ever produced and in my top five overall. Nick Wilde also excels as a supporting character, even coming across as amusing and likable early when the movie clearly does not want us to feel that way about him yet.The best part about these two characters, and the way they interact with each other, is that, despite being depicted as total contrasts, they are both smart, constantly one-upping and shooting one-liners at each other, so much so that you are guaranteed not to pick up all of them in your first viewing.One scene, for example, has Judy quip after tallying up a figure that ""we (rabbits) are good at multiplying."" I didn't realize that this was a double-meaning until much later, not because I didn't get it (there's another joke about rabbits and the way they breed that is much more ham-fisted in its delivery), but because I was too busy laughing at everything else going on during this scene to even notice it.Some of the absolute best scenes (and thank Jaguar Jesus, there are many of them) are when Nick and Judy are alone and just talking. They have some of the best dialogue -- the best character interaction -- in any animated film that I can remember, so much so that I would honestly be interested in a spin off TV series or set of animated shorts that was just the two of them sharing an apartment or chatting while on patrol. They are that good together.The plot, though a clear and obvious (and often clumsy) metaphor for discrimination, is by no means predictable, and while you will likely figure right from the start that the character being set up as the villain is not the villain, it will make you wonder if there even IS a villain.Spoiler alert: There is a villain. And the big reveal of who it is isn't that surprising since some of the earlier-revealed accomplices are the same species. But while it is obvious who is going to be revealed as the main villain at the climax, it did still surprise me (albeit not in hindsight) to know in advance that was who it was going to be.And frankly, the big tragedy of them not getting more into the dynamics behind their stereotypes is that it would have been an opportunity to better explore the setting. Zootopia is the most compelling setting -- the greatest foundation for an entire franchise -- that Disney has ever produced.A sequel? Pfft. Zootopia warrants sequels, prequels, spin off movies, spin off TV series, an entire theme park of its own and a multi-server MMORPG. It is THAT GOOD.This movie's faults are glaring, absolutely, and it's a tragedy that they were not addressed, because everything else is pure epic awesomeness.

6,2023-04-24,"This was a quintessential Disney experience. It was cute and clever and it pandered to every stereotypical Disney emotion. The prevailing sentiment here was ""you can be whatever you want to be, if you just try try try."" Also, ""don't judge someone based on their heritage alone, you have to give them a chance to show their true self before making any assumptions."" All nice, all well and good, but redundant.We are in a metropolis in a world where all animals live in peace, except humans who are somehow non-existent. Predators no longer prey on weaker species. Lions and gazelles live together in harmony. Rats, moles, rabbits, foxes, wolves, bears, they're all living and working together in this world, having evolved past their respective savage natures. How? Its unclear. Is this at all possible in some fictionalized historical timeline? Perhaps, perhaps no, but if one is asking about possibilities in a Disney movie one is looking at it all wrong. It isn't about what's possible. Anything is possible. Its about does this make any sense, and to me, this concept was clever but it made no sense. It seemed to have been thrown together for the sake of a few jokes. And really the jokes did work, but to have an entire premise built solely for the purpose of leading to some animal jokes is lazy and flimsy.I did enjoy the movie, on a very superficial level. But it gave my soul nothing it needed. The message fell flat for me because I have found one cannot be anything one wants. I do not mean that cynically, I mean it as a practicality.

8,2016-03-10,"The film displays many discourses on real world subjects and for that I give this a thumbs up. Though it may not explicitly refer to the real world, there are definitely similarities in Zootopia in which children growing up can extend to their world. The stereotyping based on appearance and 'biology' was a big theme in the film, and ultimately hints at race (that is how I interpreted it anyhow). I feel that the film did a great job at discussing the stigma attached to certain appearances, as well as finding a resolution to this way of thought. Appearances do not govern who we are, and biology does not dictate who we become.Additionally, the script is superb and keeps audiences engaged. The voice actors did a great job - as did the animators, to create the life of these characters. I also really loved (and was also somewhat annoyed by) the addition of the sloths. They added a comedic and recurrent comedic effect, and their slow motion is both hilarious and frustrating to watch.Though I do think the characters and voice actors complemented each other well, I noticed that certain characters would have accents. For example, the 'mafia' like character, Mr. Big (Maurice LaMarche) has a typical Latino type accent and the yoga instructor Nangi (Gita Reddy) has an Indian accent. I was quite taken aback by this and though it is great to have diversity in the cast, the film should not encourage the stereotyping of race and character. Also, large characters seemed to have loud booming voices that correlated to their size, and smaller characters tended to have softer, squeaky voices. Size does not determine pitch of voice, and this reinforces the idea that people who do not conform to this ideal is abnormal.Overall, this is a fun and engaging film with good discourses but disappointing voice stereotypes.",310,en,film display many discourse real world subject give thumb though may explicitly refer real world definitely similarity zootopia child growing extend world stereotyping based appearance biology big theme film ultimately hint race interpreted anyhow feel film great job discussing stigma attached certain appearance well finding resolution way thought appearance govern biology dictate become additionally script superb keep audience engaged voice actor great job animator create life character also really loved also somewhat annoyed addition sloth added comedic recurrent comedic effect slow motion hilarious frustrating watch though think character voice actor complemented well noticed certain character would accent example mafia like character mr big maurice lamarche typical latino type accent yoga instructor nangi gita reddy indian accent quite taken aback though great diversity cast film encourage stereotyping race character also large character seemed loud booming voice correlated size smaller character tended softer squeaky voice size determine pitch voice reinforces idea people conform ideal abnormal overall fun engaging film good discourse disappointing voice stereotype,2016-03,162,2.608101952413375
8,2016-03-03,"Going in, French celebrities and festivities aside, I didn't know what to expect. Unlike most people I didn't looove Frozen, I actually fell asleep watching it, so I was worried. But Zootopia exceeded my expectations with a compelling story, it's good. The story is interesting and smart. It deals with societal issues in a very witty way because it caters to kids as much as adults, which is probably why there is a certain predictability about the characters but it's not at the cost of the story or the message behind it.It's a Disney animation movie so of course there're positive teachable messages in the movie, perseverance, tolerance, open-mindedness, all wrapped in a funny and touching movie with characters that you'll root for and love.Zootopia is a good time at the movies, you'll laugh and be entertain as much as the kids.

7,2025-02-25,"This is an animated feature that I'm not fully sure that I'd ever have seen if not for having a child. My wife, Jaime, put this on to see if Mackenzie would watch it. She enjoys these types of films and since we have Disney+, that makes it easier. She also loves animals so there's that as well. She started this on a friend and finished it Sunday when we had time to sit down to watch.We start this off with getting a lay of the world. It is made up of animals. There are your predators and prey. They've learned to live together with Zootopia being a modern marvel where all different climates make up the city. Our main character is Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin). Ever since she was a child, she wanted to be a police officer. It is uncommon for a prey to be in a role like this. It also makes her parents, Bonnie (voiced by Bonnie Hunt) and Stu (voiced by Don Lake), nervous.She is bound and determined to become the first rabbit officer and she does. It isn't what she necessarily thinks though, as she is assigned to being a meter maid. She doesn't let that stop her though. Through happenstance, she lands herself in the middle of an investigation and puts her career on the line to solve it. She gets aid from a conman, Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), who is a fox. The plot that they're uncovering takes them all over Zootopia and the corruption beneath.What I'll say is that this is a fun way to introduce police procedural, crime and even neo-noir to children. It isn't as dark, obviously, but I can see the elements of films like this throughout. Something this does well in playing with animal stereotypes to incorporate into their characters. It also has a good message of not 'judging a book' by its cover by showing that despite these, there are still individuals.What also helps is just having a great cast of voice actors here as well. Bateman is perfect in his role as this sly fox. It fits so well. Goodwin works as his counterpart. They play well off each other. We also get the likes of Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, Hunt, Lake, Tommy Chong, J. K. Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Shakira, John DiMaggio and Tommy Lister Jr., to just name a few. Everyone here is on point for their characters.Then to finish out with filmmaking, since this is Disney, it looks great. I still prefer the old school style of animation, but the colors here pop. They make the different worlds within this city feel real. I love the time and care put into it. Watching this on the 4K TV helps for sure. The animation does look smooth and the different things they do their work. Not one I expected to enjoy as much as I did. I had a lot of fun and would recommend it if you want something that is light-hearted. It does work for the sub-genres that it is paying homage to as well.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",524,en,animated feature fully sure ever seen child wife jaime put see mackenzie would watch enjoys type film since disney make easier also love animal well started friend finished sunday time sit watch start getting lay world made animal predator prey learned live together zootopia modern marvel different climate make city main character judy hopps voiced ginnifer goodwin ever since child wanted police officer uncommon prey role like also make parent bonnie voiced bonnie hunt stu voiced lake nervous bound determined become first rabbit officer necessarily think though assigned meter maid let stop though happenstance land middle investigation put career line solve get aid conman nick wilde voiced jason bateman fox plot uncovering take zootopia corruption beneath say fun way introduce police procedural crime even neo noir child dark obviously see element film like throughout something well playing animal stereotype incorporate character also good message judging book cover showing despite still individual also help great cast voice actor well bateman perfect role sly fox fit well goodwin work counterpart play well also get like idris elba jenny slate hunt lake tommy chong j k simmons octavia spencer alan tudyk shakira john dimaggio tommy lister jr name everyone point character finish filmmaking since disney look great still prefer old school style animation color pop make different world within city feel real love time care put watching k tv help sure animation look smooth different thing work one expected enjoy much lot fun would recommend want something light hearted work sub genre paying homage well rating,2025-02,253,2.2903346861819927
10,2016-03-18,"When Disney Animation Studios releases a new picture, it is almost guaranteed to gain an outstanding receipt at the box office. Disney has managed to come with many great surprises over the last six decades, and although there have been a few disappointments every now and then, they have proved to have effective standards on gaining the attention of audiences everywhere. In this new Disney animated picture, Ginnifer Goodwin does the voice of Judi Hopps, a bunny with the dreams of becoming the first bunny to be a cop instead of settling with a typical bunny job of farming carrots, much to the doubt of every other animals in the world. Standing against all odds, she makes it through the police academy and wins position as a cop in the police department headed by a rhino Chief Bogo (voiced by Idris Alba) of Zootopia, a city where all animal types, predator and prey, get along well. When a case of fourteen missing otters comes up, Judi steps up and volunteers for the case and is given 48 hours to crack the case with the help of a con artist fox named Nick (voiced by Jason Bateman). Featuring a supporting cast of Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, J.K Simmons, Don Lake, Octavia Spencer, Shakira, and many others; this animated picture brings solid laughter to please kids and adults alike while conveying its deep crucial message that resonates with the issues that go on in our society today.I was utterly surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie. It took me by a surprise on many levels. While it succeeds on bringing decent family-friendly laughter and eye-popping state-of-the-art animation that shows how far we have come along with technology with recent years, one of the most surprising aspects comes from its political message about society and the issues that America struggles with today. One of which is racism. As the story follows a bunny who pursues her dreams of becoming a police officer while battling the doubt of many who believe bunnies are too small and weak to survive as cops, it underlines an example of how racism and prejudice still affects our society. And as the film progresses, it digs deeper and deeper into this theme and the message grew more powerful, giving the story a more intellectual feel while still entertaining the audiences with its light-hearted humor. And the movie balances this so well that to where it can appeal to both adults, children, and even teens alike. While kids may not pick up on its message and just shrug off depending on their age, they will nonetheless find joy and laughter at the uplifting story and outgoing humor. Yes, there are a few jokes that only adults will pick up on, but plenty of kids jokes are thrown out here as well. Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are both fantastic as the two main characters, the same goes for Idris Alba as the rhino who at first has doubts for Judi serving for the police department for the small little bunny she is. The film also has a message about not giving up and following your dreams regardless of what people tell you, and I think that is an important message kids will to come learn.Zootopia is by far one of the best animated features I have seen in a long time, and one every family should go see. It is very funny, very original, and astoundingly entertaining on many levels. And it is pretty safe to say this movie could make a contender for the Best Animated Picture at the Oscars.

The Big Hero might be equally good.) It actually make people believe that they can do anything if they try hard and that's the very reason why I love Disney cartoons. And the name ""Zootopia"" (don't know why IMDb displays Zuutopia...) is just as good as the movie. Before watching it, I wondered ""what the heck does that mean"", but now I can't help applauding for the naming.Secondly, the rabbit is the cutest thing I have ever seen. And the sloth, his show was so hilarious that it made me laughed out loudly in the cinema... And the story is intriguing. For most the cartoons, I can figure out who the villain is after 20 mins of watching, but Zootopia really made me think for a little while.Another reason why I love Zootopia, is because I asked a girl to be my girlfriend after watching the cartoon together, and she said YES, how could I not love rank it 10 out of 10!!!",206,en,watched movie min ago wait share much loved first think zootopia crowning work among disney recent cartoon mean frozen inside good dinosaur big hero might equally good actually make people believe anything try hard reason love disney cartoon name zootopia know imdb display zuutopia good movie watching wondered heck mean help applauding naming secondly rabbit cutest thing ever seen sloth show hilarious made laughed loudly cinema story intriguing cartoon figure villain min watching zootopia really made think little another reason love zootopia asked girl girlfriend watching cartoon together said yes could love rank,2016-04,93,2.8607334412394554

7,2016-07-13,"Imagine a world like the one we people live in, only we are all animals. And not just some animals, all animals together. Zootopia is one of Disney's films from this year and it has really become an international success. In this world of animals, a lot of them grow up into already decided places and positions. If you are a bunny, you should become a carrot farmer. Judy Hopps is exactly that kind of bunny, born and raised outside of the city of Zootopia. She decides at an early age to become something more. After graduating from the police academy as the first bunny ever to do so, she moves to the big city. She soon discovers that it is a long way to the top and not everyone in the animal world is getting along as well as she thought. She is quickly drawn into kidnappings that go higher up than anyone in Zootopia could have imagined. Great voice actors lent their voices for the film, such as Jason Bateman, Idris Elba and Ginnifer Goodwin.Firstly I got to say that I was positively surprised. Partly due to the fact that the film was awesome, but also because it really wasn't at all what I expected. Sure it is a family film but forget the standard family film formula. We are talking Swedish Beck and Wallander combined with American police films. Sometimes the film is actually scary and exciting, but most of all it is well thought out. We follow mostly Hopps and and Nick Wilde the fox, as they struggle to discover who or what's behind the mysterious kidnappings. We are even offered some plot twists and just when you thought we were getting close to the end, the film takes another turn and becomes something else. Very strong and bravely done by Disney.Zootopia's strongest points lies in the relationship between the animals. It is a ""the small person against the big"" film. Hopps is a small herbivore among predators that for a long time ago used to eat animals like her. Anti-racial messages and tolerance is clearly visible in the film. It does not try and hide the fact that we may all look different and have various preferences, but we are all equal and deserving of a chance in life. When you sometimes think that the film will end, the filmmakers does not hesitate to twist it one more time and deliver another punch to our heads about moral and value. Zootopia could be Disney's most political and strongest equality praising film to date. It will certainly remain for a long time in my memory because it dares to ask us these difficult questions and also to venture outside of the frames of the family film genre and sometimes become almost a thriller. Very high level of surprise and entertaining for a family film.

That was the case here and - yes, I found it entertaining.It's basically a story about evolved animals that live in a harmonious, modern-age city called ""Zootopia"". It's ""harmonious"" because predators and prey live and work together without stereotypes and labels.Well -- that's what everyone wants to believe, but reality is a bit more messy. This is what a young female bunny named Judy learns when she pursues her dream to become a police officer. She also stumbles onto a mysterious case ... and things get interesting.It may sound a bit corny and adolescent, but the story and themes aren't. It's well-written with clever dialog, an engaging plot mystery and likable characters.Plus, ""Zootopia"" is like this big world with different zones or habitats for different types of animal species. It's a pretty cool concept in itself.The only thing I didn't like is that much of film's environments are too dark (visually) with gloomy skies and a general lack of vibrant colors. Better background color contrast would have been nice too. I'm going to guess this was a stylistic call to highlight something about the story -- but I don't think it was worth it.Anyhow, that notwithstanding, I'd say this is a great movie for kids - lots of action, fun characters and nice variety of visual locations and props.For the adults: if you enjoy movies like Shrek and the Lego Movie, you might enjoy this movie.

8,2016-03-03,"Ever since the turn of the 2010s, Walt Disney Animation Studios has been skyrocketing than ever before with great momentum. From an aspiring restaurateur who became a frog, a princess with long magical hair, a bad guy wanting to be good, a tale of two sisters, and even a troubled boy with his inflatable robot companion. For their latest flick called Zootopia, it's an intriguing caper comedy that not only spoofs the buddy-cop detective formula or noir like in 1988's Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but also tackles the themes that exist in PC (politically correct) culture. In this day and age, political correctness has been ongoing with the media exploiting the misunderstandings and atrocities happening in current events such as injustice and discrimination. Thinking back on the old 1946 Disney film Song of the South featuring characters Br'er Fox and Br'er Rabbit, that's where PC is finally drawn into this movie's characters and ""species-ism"" is tested.Jason Bateman (Horrible Bosses, Paul) voices con artist, street smart fox Nick Wilde as he makes a living in the animal-inhabited metropolis hustling various individuals. At the same time rural rabbit Judy Hopps (voiced by Once Upon A Time's Ginnifer Goodwin) has just arrived in the big city to begin her first day as the first rabbit officer. Although swift, skilled, and able to hold out on her own, fellow officers don't exactly see her capable of reaching their ranks. It's up to both natural enemies to work together when a crime is committed in the seemingly blissful Zootopia, while at the same time learning that they're not so different from each other.I have to say that in the studio's current Revival Era, the animators have really stepped it up a notch by exploring a PC-coated world completely devoid of all humans and where anthropomorphic animals dominate compared to childhood Disney classics I remembered in the 90s. I'm aware that this ""human-less"" concept has been done before for many decades during Walt Disney's lifetime and even after his passing, but it looks like nearly everything actually stands out from spoofed product placements to the current trends of music, technology, fashion, and lifestyle. Disney's 1973 movie Robin Hood helped open that door when adding animals in place of the usual human characters, but this time more attention to detail from the largest to the tiniest in the architectural designs looking like a cross between Times Square and Dubai (heck, even a hint of San Fransokyo). And then there's its inhabitants; they are what makes this entire movie look appealing, inviting, relatable, and immersive. Gazelle's (Shakira) song ""Try Everything"" was also pretty entrancing to my ears. Disney easter eggs are also pleasing to keep a look out for (try finding some!)To conclude, although the movie does slightly ride off its rails in some scenes involving the lack of exploring further into the other regions that connect to the big city and a concept of an individual who is ostracized based on who they are or what they look like is vaguely similar to 2012's Wreck-It Ralph; it recovers with a thoughtful moral about the big city with real-life social issues and stereotypes being overwhelming and even troubling at times. Basically, a kid version of the 2004 Oscar-winning film Crash. But it's really about finding your true potential and not letting naysayers get the better of you.

8,2016-02-16,"Walt Disney studios has been anthropomorphizing animals since before any of us were born, and it goes to show that they picked up a couple of tricks along the way. What an amazing world they have created for this movie, with tons of great details both in the forefront and in the background. Some jokes were obvious, while some I'm sure go over the head of the mostly young audience that will see this movie. The different parts of the city, how the animals live together despite physical differences, all of it is a delight to watch. And it's rendered beautifully.There are some parts of this movie that I'm not that big a fan of. The visual style of this movie is nice, but it's also very similar to what we have seen before. In Frozen, Tangled and this, we see Disney turning the style used in their traditional animation movies being converted into these computer generated styles. Maybe it is because other studios has also taken inspiration from Disney's old movies, but the animals in this movie mostly look very similar to what we have seen before in Dreamworks movies, for instance. While it was all still beautiful, the characters all felt like (really nice) ""stock CGI-models"".The ending was a bit of a let down too. It's as ""noir"" as the rest of the movie, but underwhelming. Most likely because they did not want to go ""darker"", as this is a Disney-movie. Obviously we can't expect it to go as far as ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"", but a bit more would have helped.All in all, it's a really fun movie that everyone can enjoy.

10,2016-03-08,"When one thinks of animation, walking and talking animals come to mind. Even at the start of animation, characters like Mickey Mouse and Felix the Cat were human-like animals that were the stars of the genre as they could speak to everyone and still be as entertaining as any human. Warner Brothers has the Looney Tunes, which is full of anthropomorphic animal-characters that perform vaudeville routines like a regular human comedian. MGM has Tom and Jerry, the ultimate battle to the death as a cat and mouse should, yet still make their slapstick comedy relatable enough for people to connect with. Now Disney has an interesting note with walking, talking animals.Despite having a mascot that's anthropomorphic, Disney haven't made much content with human- like animals. 101 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp and The Jungle Book has such creatures, but live in a world full of people that are the dominant species. In the case of an entire world of animals, I can only think of Robin Hood (which I really like) and Chicken Little (which I consider one of Disney's worst) that have pulled that off. Zootopia takes that same idea, but really takes advantage of the environment it creates to create something really unique.Judy Hopps (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is a bunny who has always wanted to be a cop. She's constantly told by everyone, even her parents, that bunnies cannot be police officers due to their size and cute look. She proves them wrong and passes the police academy first in her class and a position in the metropolis of Zootopia. Though promised that she would receive the same treatment like her fellow officers, her police captain Chief Bogo (played by Idris Elba) assigns her parking duty. Rather then complain, she takes her new assignment with excitement, hoping her work effort will lead to something better.After arresting a thieving weasel, she given a chance to find a missing otter within forty-eight hours or risk having to resign. The only clue she has is a photo from where Emmet Otterton was last seen. She finds a clue that leads her to a sly, con artist fox Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman). Though she has a prejudice against foxes (due to her past), they team up to find the otter. Their various clues take them to a nudist club run by a Yak (played by Tommy Chong), a DMV run by sloths, and even a crime boss shrew named Mr. Big in order to discover the bigger mystery within the city.When I heard about Zootopia, I wasn't sure if more could be offered to the anthropomorphic animal setting. I was not only proved wrong, but this blew me away. The folks at Disney should be city designers as Zootopia feels like a legitimate city with it's various sections. From the desert to the tundra and even a section for rodents, the city could rank up with Los Angeles in Blade Runner or Gotham in Batman. I'll be surprised if something from this movie is not incorporated into the Disney Parks.The voice acting is simply perfect with Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as a good set of buddies in this cop story. Speaking of mysteries, the case to be solved was very intriguing and manages to pull off a moral that's perfect with the recent news stories of racism and gender discrimination. I assume that Disney had wanted to tell a story on racism and prejudice for a while and Zootopia should get the adults to think while keeping the children entertained with some great slapstick that remains fast and essential to the plot.I'll give this ten Nick Wildes out of ten. While Frozen may have been the major Disney movie that people wouldn't stop talking about, Zootopia has a chance to divert that attention as it already has for me. I highly recommend this for everyone, especially for adults, even if they claim they don't like animation.",658,en,one think animation walking talking animal come mind even start animation character like mickey mouse felix cat human like animal star genre could speak everyone still entertaining human warner brother looney tune full anthropomorphic animal character perform vaudeville routine like regular human comedian mgm tom jerry ultimate battle death cat mouse yet still make slapstick comedy relatable enough people connect disney interesting note walking talking animal despite mascot anthropomorphic disney made much content human like animal dalmatian lady tramp jungle book creature live world full people dominant specie case entire world animal think robin hood really like chicken little consider one disney worst pulled zootopia take idea really take advantage environment creates create something really unique judy hopps played ginnifer goodwin bunny always wanted cop constantly told everyone even parent bunny cannot police officer due size cute look prof wrong pass police academy first class position metropolis zootopia though promised would receive treatment like fellow officer police captain chief bogo played idris elba assigns parking duty rather complain take new assignment excitement hoping work effort lead something better arresting thieving weasel given chance find missing otter within forty eight hour risk resign clue photo emmet otterton last seen find clue lead sly con artist fox nick wilde played jason bateman though prejudice fox due past team find otter various clue take nudist club run yak played tommy chong dmv run sloth even crime bos shrew named mr big order discover bigger mystery within city heard zootopia sure could offered anthropomorphic animal setting proved wrong blew away folk disney city designer zootopia feel like legitimate city various section desert tundra even section rodent city could rank los angeles blade runner gotham batman surprised something movie incorporated disney park voice acting simply perfect ginnifer goodwin jason bateman good set buddy cop story speaking mystery case solved intriguing manages pull moral perfect recent news story racism gender discrimination assume disney wanted tell story racism prejudice zootopia get adult think keeping child entertained great slapstick remains fast essential plot give ten nick wilde ten frozen may major disney movie people stop talking zootopia chance divert attention already highly recommend everyone especially adult even claim like animation,2016-03,362,2.4967234193845993

9,2016-05-13,"Pixar is booming again. John Lasseter, the producer behind Toy Story, the Incredibles, Wreck it Ralph and a long list of successful animated movies, has brought to life another cohesive story that continues the pattern of thoroughly wrapped up films.Everything from the colours, the different styles and the voice direction works in harmony so well that you will quickly be caught up in the subtleties of Zootopia. Characters are fully realized, with compelling back stories that evoke empathy from the viewer, political motives provide a layer of intrigue and inspirational events will have you dreaming one minute, and shrinking in despair the next. It is this ability to tell a story with every element of the on-screen experience that continues to set this team apart.If there is a criticism to be had, it would have to come from the unwitting power of that ability to tell a story. Considering the age of a typical animated film, Directors will often debate the value of added layers of effect; one for adults, and one for kids. For the most part, the balance is there, with some raunchy humour slipped in here and there, and some jokes that kids won't get but will have the adults doubling over when every worker at the DMV is, quite literally, a sloth. It is in the larger elements of the story that reveal its roots in classic cop films, setting itself with an uncharacteristic irresponsibility and some shock scenes that are designed to produce fear in children. These scenes would not be so effective if not for its powerful ability to convey a story.An example would be the depiction of authority figures in the film. There are no positive leaders, and no restoration in the film of those leaders. Political leaders are corrupt, parents are backwater dream-killers and bosses are narrow-minded, unapproachable, and manipulative. This is part of a significant staging of a major conflict of the character's dream, pitted against ""the machine"". However, the conflict is never fully resolved as ""the machine"" is destabilized and then restored, but never truly changed.An item of awareness for parents may come in the presentation of several classes living in Utopian harmony, represented by animals, but loaded with political and ethical undertones. To someone who shares these values, it may go unnoticed, but for people representing minority cultures or of a different ethical compass, the story lays it on pretty thick and could stimulate an interesting discussion around points of separation in the culture. For example, what makes it possible for predator and prey to live in harmony? Why are animals segregated according to size and their environment? Is it really a ""Zootopian"" society when everyone lives separately? This could be one of the most culturally influential movies in this decade due to its reach and appeal, and its ability to tell a story with a purpose.",478,en,pixar booming john lasseter producer behind toy story incredibles wreck ralph long list successful animated movie brought life another cohesive story continues pattern thoroughly wrapped film everything colour different style voice direction work harmony well quickly caught subtlety zootopia character fully realized compelling back story evoke empathy viewer political motif provide layer intrigue inspirational event dreaming one minute shrinking despair next ability tell story every element screen experience continues set team apart criticism would come unwitting power ability tell story considering age typical animated film director often debate value added layer effect one adult one kid part balance raunchy humour slipped joke kid get adult doubling every worker dmv quite literally sloth larger element story reveal root classic cop film setting uncharacteristic irresponsibility shock scene designed produce fear child scene would effective powerful ability convey story example would depiction authority figure film positive leader restoration film leader political leader corrupt parent backwater dream killer boss narrow minded unapproachable manipulative part significant staging major conflict character dream pitted machine however conflict never fully resolved machine destabilized restored never truly changed item awareness parent may come presentation several class living utopian harmony represented animal loaded political ethical undertone someone share value may go unnoticed people representing minority culture different ethical compass story lay pretty thick could stimulate interesting discussion around point separation culture example make possible predator prey live harmony animal segregated according size environment really zootopian society everyone life separately could one culturally influential movie decade due reach appeal ability tell story purpose,2016-05,252,2.4959296175797445
10,2018-02-09,"Zootopia tells the story of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde who are a bunny and a fox respectively who are trying to solve a case together.I am saying this is one of pixar's best is because it is bold enough to go where other pixar movies didn't go. From the movie start I was surprised by Judy which is such a loveable character and at the same time such an optimistic person that tries to be better and better even though she fails a lot of times just like Shakira's song says in both the beginning and end of this movie. The animation is the best ever from pixar and I've seen Coco which is newer than this but in Zootopia there were some scenes in which everything seemed real, really. The voice acting is fantastic and the standouts are these two leading characters, Idris Elba and JK Simmons' characters respectively. The story is so mature and so rich with countless moral lessons for both kids and adults but the thing I loved about it is that it gave so much depth to this two characters that at a point in the movie I thought I was watching a real movie about a police case. There are so many twist and exciting moments in this film where I was either laughing very hard or shocked or amazed by the courage this movie had with the story it told. I honestly don't have a single gripe or flaw with movie and that's why for me it's one of pixar's best along with 2017's Coco.

7,2016-07-12,"Zootopia is one of the highest grossing animated films of 2016, and for the right reasons. It has unique characters, a clever plot which explores important themes, and stunning animation. It seems people are not seeing the movie for what it is; something that may not necessarily be suited for young children, with themes that should be portrayed in films for an older audience. Regardless, this is a terrific film that the entire family can enjoy, and deserves praise for this.The film revolves around a young rabbit called Judy, who has from a young age aspired to be a police officer. And, from a young age, she has faced adversity in the form of racial prejudice; well, translated into the animal kingdom. This racial prejudice is the key theme of the film, explored through different species of animals rather than different races.To Judy, living in the country on her parents' farm, Zootopia is a far-off city where ''anyone can be anything''. These dreams are completely dashed away when she is accepted into the Zootopia Police Force. Here, she faces discrimination from all corners, including mainly officers at the police department and her boss Chief Bogo, a mean, apathetic buffalo. This comes from the stereotype (another key theme of the film) that rabbits are ''dumb''.Her dreams are almost shattered when Chief Bogo threatens to fire her (for a silly reason), giving her one chance to solve a missing animal case.Teaming up with Nick, a fox con-artist, the pair begin an adventure that changes Zootopia and its prejudice forever.The movie is to be applauded for the impressive way it explores discrimination. Never before has an animated film so stunningly explored these themes in a way that leaves viewers thinking about its meaning long after watching the movie. How it does this is simple; reiterating through Nick and Judy, both victims of prejudice, the harsh stereotypes that are employed by Zootopians. Through Judy, we are able to empathise with her as her experiences unfold. Through Nick, we are able to see how, bullied at a young age via stereotypical discrimination, his life was shaped.In Zootopia, predators are the minority seen as dangerous. Clearly this fear is just another stereotype that is explored cleverly, attempting to show how fear based on stereotypes is commonly unsubstantiated.The characters are unique in this film too. From Judy's protective parents who early on blatantly state how they are happy because they gave up on their dreams, to the resilient and studious Judy herself, Nick the seemingly sly con-artist who really represents far more, the Chief who is an obvious biased and the assistant mayor who is apparently under-appreciated by the mayor himself, although she ends up representing far more than just that.Zootopia features amazing animation, which truly brings to life the characters. In a movie featuring animals this is a necessity and Zootopia definitely fulfills this criterion.But every movie has its flaws. As great as Zootopia is, there are certain aspects that are underestimated in their influence. For example, the film is clearly scary at times. While not obvious at first, certain scenes featuring the ''savage'' animals have the potential to frighten the younger viewers. This is probably a little paranoid, but remembering that this is a kids movie it is important to note.Even more noticeable is the plot. Sure, an adult could follow it with ease. But children are going to have difficulty understanding what is happening. Certain plot developments will not make sense; more so than other animated films because this is a detective story. Of course, for the most part children do not understand plots regardless of their complexity, and thankfully, while not teeming with it, the film does have humour that will entertain the kids.Prejudice within the film is arguably its best feature. However, at the same time it has its flaws, namely that it is explored rather brutally; the Chief is quite rude to Judy, the Fox bully at the start is mean (''you think you will ever be more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny?''), and Nick's flashback is somewhat graphic. Although these are all eventually resolved, it seems its exploration was harsh.You see, the truth of the matter is that Zootopia is a complex film. It explores themes that usually do not form a part of animated films, through a typical partner-cop detective story, with scenes that may appear in a horror movie filmed as live-action. To the most part it succeeds at exploring prejudice, however its detective story can be confusing at times, and as for the savage scenes, it's clear after a second look that they may appear frightening. Again, perhaps that's paranoid to think, but still.Push this all aside, and Zootopia is a great film. The reason it has been received so well is because it is a film that both kids and adults can thoroughly enjoy, a rarer combination nowadays. It is to be praised for how well it handles prejudicial themes, stereotypes and discrimination, alongside its clever, witty characters that really allow viewers to connect, and quality animation which truly brings the film to life.Zootopia is one of those rare gems that the entire family will be entertained by.

10,2016-09-18,"When you see the famous animation of Disney mascot Mickey Mouse before a movie begins, you know it's going to be good, and like many of Pixar's latest, Zootropolis does not fail to impress.In short, Zootropolis is about the inventively named bunny cop Judy Hopps, whose unfailing determination to become a fully-fledged officer sees her finding a position in the city from which the film gains its title.It is here that the main plot, which deals with some rather impressive themes such as prejudice, discrimination, and the social divide between predator and prey (likely a facsimile for the apartheid between black and white skinned people in 1960s America, or, a more modern example, the tension dividing Muslims and non-Muslims in modern society), begins.That is not to say that the entire movie is heavy, or that it is unfit for children. Like many of the recent Pixar masterpieces, it has the genius of hiding lessons like these; important messages that hold true meaning in the real world; in plain sight.This means that adults will see these deeply-embedded references and relate, thinking back with thoughts of ""I remember when the world was like that"" - an olden voice reminiscing from within, while kids enjoy the movie for the cute, lovable characters and witty, humorous dialogue.Speaking of humor, this film most certainly has a lot to boot. Nearly every scene will have you roaring with laughter, or at the very least, sporting a merry grin, especially in the scenes containing co-star Jason Bateman's Nick Wilde - devious fox con-artist, between whom and Hopps, some of the most entertaining one-liners in the movie will pass.This movie also has one of the best plots seen in recent movie years. The plots' many twists and turns will have you clinging for dear life to the edge of your popcorn-spattered seat as Hopps and Wilde chase leads across all four districts of Zootropolis, from frozen tundra to mist-enveloped mountaintops, and from sprawling metropolis to desolate jungle, each new location will definitely have you enticed.While I cannot force you to take out your wallet and cough up a handful of cash to watch this movie, I would thoroughly recommend that you do.

9,2016-09-22,"The Disney film Zootopia is set in a world where animals have evolved and now live much like humans do. The film Zootopia centers on the rabbit with a big dream, the up beat, lovable, Judy Hopps, voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin (Walk the Line, Once Upon a Time). Judy Hopps was a small town rabbit with dreams of being a respected and loved police officer, who moves to the city Zootopia. While Judy is indeed successful in becoming a cop, notably the first ever rabbit to do so, she is still overlooked by everyone, including Police Chief Bogo, voiced by Idris Elba (Pacific Rim, The Jungle Book) and assigned to parking duty.However, Judy takes it upon herself to begin an investigating. A series of local disappearances, Judy needs the help of Nick Wilde, voiced by Jason Bateman (Starsky and Hutch, Horrible Bosses), a con artist fox she had previously encountered. With her job on the line, the two begin to discover the disappearances in Zootopia are tied into a conspiracy and a cover-up involving some locals.""The Big D"", better known as Disney has 80 years or more of experience making animated films, so saying that Disney has made another family film is not anything particularly noteworthy. It is what we have come to expect. While best known for their musicals, princesses, and prince charming, Disney animation has been on a roll of late with animated movies with a message. Like the Academy Award winning Big Hero 6 and Wreck-It Ralph. However, Zootopia is not simply another fun Disney animated movie. It is one of the greatest Disney animated movies I have seen in the last ten years.From a technical standpoint, Zootopia is top notch. The animation is gorgeous. All of the animals look spectacular. Each creature looks alive, real, and emotional on screen. Action scenes are fun, exciting, and a joy to watch. I have not seen Disney to great-animated action sequences like this since Toy Story 2. The action scenes will have you gasping, on the edge of your seat, and invested in the moment. The world is so colorful, bold, and a world you actually want to invest in. Accordingly, the voice cast works well. In addition to Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman we get the talents of J.K. Simmons (Spider-Man, Whiplash), Idris Elba, and musical artist Shakira, among others. Every actor and character is perfectly matched!To Heavy of a Message for a Kids Film?The story is so much more than just a buddy cop film, between a fox and a rabbit. The film is clever, has great inside reference jokes, there are a lot of jokes for adults that will go way over kids' head (references to The Godfather, the DMV, and Breaking Bad, for instance), but there's plenty for younger audiences to laugh at, too, and it all comes wrapped in great messages about courage, empathy, tolerance, teamwork, and the dangers of reducing others to stereotypes. I know this is a kid's movie, and this may not be politically correct. But, this movie has cojones (I'm talking' 'bout balls)! For a kid's film to tackle on the subject of race, stereotypes, relations, profiling, discrimination and bullying is really brave.Everyone can connect to this movie, and that what makes it beautiful. You can view it multiple times, and still learn something new. Something new about yourself, something new about society, some new jokes, overall something amazing every time for kids and adults. My only complaint about this film is, for a kid's movie, it is a little lengthy. Also, I am not sure if kids will understand the entire message, and laugh as much as they would like to.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the film Zootopia. It is Clever and heartwarming, it has vibrant visuals, an amazing story line, and a message for the world. A message that we as a society cannot fully grasp, but an animated movie helps us along the way. This is why I like movies. They teach, inspire, and make us connected. Also, Shakira plays a singing pop star Gazelle in the movie. I thought I would never say this, but that was a sexy gazelle! I believe the Disney film Zootopia earns a9/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie.

8,2016-03-30,"Zootopia is the film that really confirms that Disney's second Renaissance is more than just a quick blip. With a heartfelt and often moving central theme, stunning animation, fantastic voice performances and an uplifting and fun-loving vibe, Zootopia had me smiling ear to ear from beginning to end.The main thing that strikes you about this film is how much it delves into its main theme, about the celebration of diversity and combating propaganda that creates a climate of fear. It's a very timely topic too, considering developments in the world over the last decade or so, but the thing that's so brilliant about Zootopia is that it brings across its message in a positive and uplifting way.Yes, it may feel a little overly preachy at times, but in the end, that doesn't matter as much, because the way that this film looks at its main theme is so upbeat. That's all emphasises by the wonderful main character, a budding young rabbit named Judy Hopps who manages to become the first bunny cop in the history of Zootropolis, proving all the stereotypes wrong to achieve her dreams.That's one side of the story, but as the film goes on, it talks about the way that fear-based political campaigns work in a slightly more dramatic, but still entertaining, simple and engaging way, which was absolutely brilliant to see, especially considering this is a kids' movie.That level of depth in Zootopia is really staggering, but we mustn't forget that the main point of this film is to give you a good time, which it does brilliantly. Although starting off in slightly generic fashion, this film develops into a really interesting mystery which actually feels a lot like a film-noir.The mystery that develops, in conjunction with the main theme about discrimination, made Zootopia play in a way that seemed oddly similar to In The Heat Of The Night to me (except with talking animals). That story is a lot of fun to follow along to, and with quite a few good jokes thrown in here and there, you won't be short of laughs either.Another really impressive thing about this film is the voice performances. In the lead role, Ginnifer Goodwin is absolutely excellent as Judy Hopps, bursting with happy energy that makes her character effortlessly likable, whilst Jason Bateman, who plays Nick Wilde, the sly fox con artist, is a lot of fun too, using his comedic experience to great effect to provide a fantastically charismatic and fun character to follow.Finally, the animation here is excellent. Disney Animation have reached levels right up there with Pixar now, and, if it weren't for the cartoonish design of the animals, this could be an almost photo- realistic animation, which you can see in the vibrant and visually stunning backdrops throughout.In the end, I loved Zootopia. Its most striking and original feature is of course its main theme, but thanks to using that in a positive way, and creating a generally uplifting film around that, it's impossible to not have a good time here.",506,en,zootopia film really confirms disney second renaissance quick blip heartfelt often moving central theme stunning animation fantastic voice performance uplifting fun loving vibe zootopia smiling ear ear beginning end main thing strike film much delf main theme celebration diversity combating propaganda creates climate fear timely topic considering development world last decade thing brilliant zootopia brings across message positive uplifting way yes may feel little overly preachy time end matter much way film look main theme upbeat emphasis wonderful main character budding young rabbit named judy hopps manages become first bunny cop history zootropolis proving stereotype wrong achieve dream one side story film go talk way fear based political campaign work slightly dramatic still entertaining simple engaging way absolutely brilliant see especially considering kid movie level depth zootopia really staggering forget main point film give good time brilliantly although starting slightly generic fashion film develops really interesting mystery actually feel lot like film noir mystery develops conjunction main theme discrimination made zootopia play way seemed oddly similar heat night except talking animal story lot fun follow along quite good joke thrown short laugh either another really impressive thing film voice performance lead role ginnifer goodwin absolutely excellent judy hopps bursting happy energy make character effortlessly likable whilst jason bateman play nick wilde sly fox con artist lot fun using comedic experience great effect provide fantastically charismatic fun character follow finally animation excellent disney animation reached level right pixar cartoonish design animal could almost photo realistic animation see vibrant visually stunning backdrop throughout end loved zootopia striking original feature course main theme thanks using positive way creating generally uplifting film around impossible good time,2016-03,272,2.868392956303364
8,2016-04-17,"As always Disney gives us a movie with lots of humor, lots of cute and funny characters and a great story for everyone. But this one in particular I thought was a bit different. From my point of view it's not only targeting kids in the first place, but adults too. The thing is that apart from the fact that the story is played out in a world where animals live together and carry the story (typical Disney environment), the story itself is actually quite similar to what the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies used to be about and more of an adult kind of plot. A police mystery with lots of action. Without the level of violence from Lethal Weapon of course, though it is kind of violent sometimes and maybe not the best movie to watch with your absolute youngest kids.There are also many references to adult movies like ""The Godfather"" that you will only find funny if you have actually seen the movie, which I doubt a 7 year old kid has. But not only that, it also takes on issues on a political level that is more than accurate around the world today: racism, sexism, xenophobia, even terrorism is executed to some extent. In my point of view that is what makes this movie darker and a bit different from other recent Disney movies. They have done a great job in taking on these themes in such a simple way that everyone can understand them. Children as well as adults.The characters are very well done! I loved the way they portray every animal, translate their abilities or peculiarities and put them to use in a modern human society. This is one thing that Disney almost never fails at. It made me crack several times and I had such a good time throughout the movie! Also I find it quite appealing that they are moving away from ""Princess- land"" since a lot of Disney movies has been about a prince or a princess in some way. We've seen all that too many times and it's what made me dislike ""Frozen"" so much. This one to me is more like ""Wall-e"" and shows us something fresh in terms of animated Disney movies.

9,2016-04-27,"'Zootopia' is the latest Disney animated feature that tells the story of a daring bunny named Judy Hopps (Gennifer Goodwin), who becomes a police officer in a city of civilized animals.1. Walt Disney pictures has outdone itself once again with this film. The animation and level of creativity put into a movie like this is simply incredible. The design of the city of 'Zootopia' itself is amazing beyond belief with sections of snow, desert and rain forest for specific animal residents. The last CGI animated film that featured animals in a civilization that was this good came in 2011's 'Rango'.2. The story-line (besides Judy becoming an officer) in centered on a string of missing animals that have gone savage. Against the wishes of her commanding officer Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), Judy is tasked with finding a missing Otter, but is unwillingly joined on her quest by a suspect and street-wise Fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). It's really fun to watch this unlikely duo help each other solve this mystery.3. Bateman steals the show just by how sarcastically funny he is in the way his character Nick interacts with Judy and his take on society as a whole. You wouldn't expect much action from a film like this, but there's a lot. In my experience, there weren't many laugh-out-loud jokes, but you get chuckles and delightful moments throughout. There is just an unbelievable majority of cool things here and there that it's hard to mention them all.Besides the Pixar films, this surely stands as a soon-to-be classic for Disney animation that topples the likes of 'Tangled' and everyone's beloved 'Frozen'. Shakira also appears in the film as an animal pop-star called 'Gazelle', who dishes out a terrific song entitled ; 'Try Everything', that leaves a mark even more so than 'Let it Go'.",303,en,zootopia latest disney animated feature tell story daring bunny named judy hopps gennifer goodwin becomes police officer city civilized animal walt disney picture outdone film animation level creativity put movie like simply incredible design city zootopia amazing beyond belief section snow desert rain forest specific animal resident last cgi animated film featured animal civilization good came rango story line besides judy becoming officer centered string missing animal gone savage wish commanding officer chief bogo idris elba judy tasked finding missing otter unwillingly joined quest suspect street wise fox named nick wilde jason bateman really fun watch unlikely duo help solve mystery bateman steal show sarcastically funny way character nick interacts judy take society whole expect much action film like lot experience many laugh loud joke get chuckle delightful moment throughout unbelievable majority cool thing hard mention besides pixar film surely stand soon classic disney animation topples like tangled everyone beloved frozen shakira also appears film animal pop star called gazelle dish terrific song entitled try everything leaf mark even let go,2016-04,171,2.4958848075028692
9,2016-03-07,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A delightfully zany animated jaunt through the detective genre with our four-legged animal friends.GRADE: B+SYNOPSIS: In this world, all animals coexist in perfect harmony and take on stereotypical human traits. This animated buddy cop film introduces an idealistic rookie bunny teaming up with a cynical fox to investigate a series of attacks.JIM'S REVIEW: The evils of prejudice and the need for diversity are the underlying themes in Disney's Zootopia. We view a pastel-colored utopia sans humans where animals are ""10% predator, 90% prey"". That is until some violence upsets the natural order of things. Which brings Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and con artist Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) together to solve this whodunit.The film spoofs film noir, detective stories, The Godfather, Breaking Bad, cop films, and other pop references as the duo go about following leads while not-too-subtly handling the message of tolerance and equality. The puns are plentiful in Jared Bush and Phil Johnson's funny screenplay which contrasts this crazy metropolis with our real world. The script uses animal profiling to the nth degree in a most seductive and insightful way which brings about much of the comedy elements.A committee of directors are credited with this film (Bryon Howard, Rich Moore, and, once again, Mr. Bush), so their individual contributions are not readily known, but their end result is seamlessly blended to create a wonderful children's film that seems more skewed for the adults in the audience.The animation is highly detailed and beautifully rendered, creating a satirical universe. The visuals work in unison with a strong narrative, so rare in today's animation which usually panders to sophomoric humor and bad story-telling. Although the filmmakers lay their overly positive message on too thickly and their politics is biased to the obvious liberal left (of which, I firmly concur), this does not interfere with one's full enjoyment of the film's overall wholesomeness and ""kumbaya"" positive vibe.Ms. Goodwin and Mr. Bateman bring such joy and credibility to their characters. Providing expert voice-overs as well are Idris Elba, J.K. Simmons, Jenny Slate, Tommy Chong (superb as a holistic yak named Yax), Nate Torrance, Bonnie Hunt, Don Lake, Shakira, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, and Raymond S. Persi as Flash, the slowest sloth clerk at the Department of Motor Vehicles, whose short (and long) bit is the film's laugh-out-loud highlight.Zootopia is the type of film whose main purpose to to entertain and amuse. Yet, it doesn't shy away from some serious issues. This animated film is not afraid to talk about the elephant in the room, even when there is an actual pachyderm in close proximity, which makes it all the more charming and memorable family fare.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",462,en,rating film highly recommended brief delightfully zany animated jaunt detective genre four legged animal friend grade b synopsis world animal coexist perfect harmony take stereotypical human trait animated buddy cop film introduces idealistic rookie bunny teaming cynical fox investigate series attack jim review evil prejudice need diversity underlying theme disney zootopia view pastel colored utopia sans human animal predator prey violence upset natural order thing brings officer judy hopps ginnifer goodwin con artist nick wilde jason bateman together solve whodunit film spoof film noir detective story godfather breaking bad cop film pop reference duo go following lead subtly handling message tolerance equality pun plentiful jared bush phil johnson funny screenplay contrast crazy metropolis real world script us animal profiling nth degree seductive insightful way brings much comedy element committee director credited film bryon howard rich moore mr bush individual contribution readily known end result seamlessly blended create wonderful child film seems skewed adult audience animation highly detailed beautifully rendered creating satirical universe visuals work unison strong narrative rare today animation usually pander sophomoric humor bad story telling although filmmaker lay overly positive message thickly politics biased obvious liberal left firmly concur interfere one full enjoyment film overall wholesomeness kumbaya positive vibe m goodwin mr bateman bring joy credibility character providing expert voice over well idris elba j k simmons jenny slate tommy chong superb holistic yak named yax nate torrance bonnie hunt lake shakira octavia spencer alan tudyk raymond persi flash slowest sloth clerk department motor vehicle whose short long bit film laugh loud highlight zootopia type film whose main purpose entertain amuse yet shy away serious issue animated film afraid talk elephant room even actual pachyderm close proximity make charming memorable family fare visit blog www dearmoviegoer comany comment please contact jadepietro rcn com,2016-03,295,2.4593944548442517
10,2016-05-13,"Let me start out by saying that I made an account just to write this review for this movie. I'm very picky about liking a movie enough to write a review, I don't haphazardly write reviews just because I can. I didn't have any expectations going in because I had never seen any trailers or reviews (heck I hadn't even heard of it) a friend just invited me to go. I like Disney (I say like with a very hesitant intonation) movies so I went. However Disney movies, in the past, have become very predictable and cliché. They are good quality and wholesome but they have always lacked something. They never had the right mix.So over the years my mind devised a grading gradient that each movie I watch had to go through. It determines if the movie is either hapless and unimpressive and be left in the ash heap of history or downright astounding to be articulated into a review. In order for a movie to impress me it has to have a good mix of elements. Here is just a simple list. 1.humor: Disney movies generally have to please children and or parentals. The demographic is typically families. So in order for movies to be ""fitting"" it has to provide a universal formula of humor. It's typically flat and unimpressive. It's not realistic. And it depends on one-liners. Give me something that has substance and comes naturally. Humor is at its best when it relates to actual real life scenarios. And is not forced or practical. 2. Character development. Sometimes Disney just gives the viewers the gist of what the portrayal of the character has to be and then slashes our hopes of what we thought it could have been. Never mind the $9.99 admission fee or the screaming kids we had to haul over to watch the movie. I GET It there is a time frame for the movie but give us more! We want our minds to be mesmerized and captivated. 3. Dialog: whispering, rough accents, things that are just hard to hear or understand (closed captions shouldn't even be an option) totally ruins it for me. And mysterious dialog that some character said in the beginning and now has nothing to do with the movie. Instead clear precise and actual real life conversations. And I don't want to rely on someone else to tell me what a character said.4.movie titles: if your going to name a movie name it with the intention that it's going to be said in the movie. Pretentious titles are offsetting and unprofessional. 5 unnecessary dark shadows: I want to see the character and don't mix it with action that has important implications later on. I shouldn't have to rely on someone else to tell me what happened. 6.excessive singing/soundtrack :I get it.its meant for kids but when the movie solely depends on the song for depth and entertainment then it does the movie a disservice. The soundtrack has to match the story-line or at least the geographic location. And singing sometimes just isn't meant to be in it. 7.love story: it's very attractive and it makes the movie more enjoyable. But Disney has a reputation of making every movie an unrealistic love story. Keep it realistic and fluid. A movie is more memorable when realistic connections are made. 8. Annoying comic reliefs. Those characters that are just there to make annoying repetitive remarks and songs. Or actions and appearances. They make the movie tacky and intolerable. Instead give us characters that add to the movie and humor that isn't completely void of substance. 9. unnecessary detours: Disney has to add some detour to make it to appear ""fun"" or to introduce new songs or characters. At the end its just adds clutter and confusion. Instead use that time to truly focus on character development. 10.forced emotional situations:we don't need to relive the lion King over and over again. And death isn't always a good Segway. Plus those deaths adds more tacky- ness and it breaks away from the cohesiveness of the story-line. Instead emotion is intricate and not always blantonly obvious. Its a subtle touch to the overall tone of the movie. This can also be said for the humor. 11.unexlained events or origins of a characters ability. A character isn't spontaneously made a certain way and then left to uncertainty of its origin or ability. This just adds to the overall quality of the movie. It makes it appear like an afterthought when it should have been the center of the movie (which it ends up being). 12. Overall message: Disney has always excelled at this. However it never ends realistically.which can be unsettling to the viewer. Give us a realistic message that can be applied to anyone. 13. twists:Disney generally is good but it lacks fluidity . Give us twists that connects to the overall movie and not just because it needs to happen. Don't make it seem like an after thought.Well I could go on and on but I just want to say that Zootopia far exceeded my expectations. It hit the mark on every single category. I've never laughed so Wholeheartedly and loud. I never lost interest and it had mystery and great fluidity. 10/10.",879,en,let start saying made account write review movie picky liking movie enough write review haphazardly write review expectation going never seen trailer review heck even heard friend invited go like disney say like hesitant intonation movie went however disney movie past become predictable clich good quality wholesome always lacked something never right mix year mind devised grading gradient movie watch go determines movie either hapless unimpressive left ash heap history downright astounding articulated review order movie impress good mix element simple list humor disney movie generally please child parentals demographic typically family order movie fitting provide universal formula humor typically flat unimpressive realistic depends one liner give something substance come naturally humor best relates actual real life scenario forced practical character development sometimes disney give viewer gist portrayal character slash hope thought could never mind admission fee screaming kid haul watch movie get time frame movie give u want mind mesmerized captivated dialog whispering rough accent thing hard hear understand closed caption even option totally ruin mysterious dialog character said beginning nothing movie instead clear precise actual real life conversation want rely someone else tell character said movie title going name movie name intention going said movie pretentious title offsetting unprofessional unnecessary dark shadow want see character mix action important implication later rely someone else tell happened excessive singing soundtrack get meant kid movie solely depends song depth entertainment movie disservice soundtrack match story line least geographic location singing sometimes meant love story attractive make movie enjoyable disney reputation making every movie unrealistic love story keep realistic fluid movie memorable realistic connection made annoying comic relief character make annoying repetitive remark song action appearance make movie tacky intolerable instead give u character add movie humor completely void substance unnecessary detour disney add detour make appear fun introduce new song character end add clutter confusion instead use time truly focus character development forced emotional situation need relive lion king death always good segway plus death add tacky ness break away cohesiveness story line instead emotion intricate always blantonly obvious subtle touch overall tone movie also said humor unexlained event origin character ability character spontaneously made certain way left uncertainty origin ability add overall quality movie make appear like afterthought center movie end overall message disney always excelled however never end realistically unsettling viewer give u realistic message applied anyone twist disney generally good lack fluidity give u twist connects overall movie need happen make seem like thought well could go want say zootopia far exceeded expectation hit mark every single category never laughed wholeheartedly loud never lost interest mystery great fluidity,2016-05,430,2.702052242542785
8,2016-11-19,"Judy Hopps is a young rabbit with dreams of one day becoming a police officer. No rabbit has ever been a police officer, but Judy perseveres and succeeds. Now she is off to Zootopia, a multi-animal society where all animals, predator and prey, live in harmony. Her euphoria and idealism is short-lived, however, as she discovers that prejudice between species still exists, and she even starts to doubt her anti-stereotyping stance. What's more, she's assigned to parking meter duty...Wonderfully original. The idea of animals harmoniously coexisting in one world, and essentially representing characters that humans would usually take, on has been done (Jungle Book, Robin Hood) but not to this extent. Some great little in-jokes and use of the different characteristics of the different animals.Nice story too, with some very engaging plots and characters. Some clever pop-cultural references too (eg The Godfather, Breaking Bad).Behind it all is a great anti-prejudice, anti-racism message which is conveyed very effectively. Maybe a little too effectively in that it is laid on a bit thick and comes across as preachy. A bit more subtlety was in order, though, for kids, the target demographic of the movie, the level was probably about right.Voice casting is spot on, with a host of stars contributing: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Tommy Chong (as a stoner, of course!), JK Simmons, Octavia Spencer, Alan Tudyk, Shakira, Bonnie Hunt.",230,en,judy hopps young rabbit dream one day becoming police officer rabbit ever police officer judy perseveres succeeds zootopia multi animal society animal predator prey live harmony euphoria idealism short lived however discovers prejudice specie still exists even start doubt anti stereotyping stance assigned parking meter duty wonderfully original idea animal harmoniously coexisting one world essentially representing character human would usually take done jungle book robin hood extent great little joke use different characteristic different animal nice story engaging plot character clever pop cultural reference eg godfather breaking bad behind great anti prejudice anti racism message conveyed effectively maybe little effectively laid bit thick come across preachy bit subtlety order though kid target demographic movie level probably right voice casting spot host star contributing ginnifer goodwin jason bateman idris elba tommy chong stoner course jk simmons octavia spencer alan tudyk shakira bonnie hunt,2016-11,142,2.4410502417813427

Not to mention, it played out like a real comedy/crime drama with twists and turns throughout. Officer Hopps embodies what many people lack that would make this world a better place--honestly, integrity, empathy, and determination.

8,2016-03-07,"Zootopia tells the story of a bunny named, Judy Hopps(Ginnifer Goodwin). Ever since she was a kid, it has always been Judy's dream to help her fellow animals, by becoming a police officer. In the world of Zootopia, humans never happened. Thousands of years ago, animals used to be savages, with predators hunting for their prey & the prey relying on their natural instinct to survive. Then, the civilized society was born. Predators & prey, learned to peacefully co-exist. Zootopia is a city where all the anthropomorphic animals live together. There are various small towns near Zootopia, that are inhabited by one particular species. Judy Hopps goes to Zootopia to pursue her dream, of becoming a cop. After all the required exams & field exercises, Judy finally becomes the first rabbit ever, to become a cop. While on the job, Officer Hopps soon realizes that being a cop is not exactly as dignified & rewarding, as she thought it would be. She finally gets an opportunity to prove her mettle as a police officer. Along with the help of a wily fox named Nick Wilde(Jason Bateman), Judy goes about solving this mystery. While on the job, Judy & Nick unearth a diabolical conspiracy, that will affect the entire society.Zootopia is a great movie! The animation is otherworldly. The city of Zootopia looks really authentic, & feels like a city that any anthropomorphic animal would flock to, for greener pastures. All the small towns around Zootopia, are gorgeous. I especially loved the rain forests. The 3D immerses the viewer, right in the middle of this beautiful world. Although this movie is wonderful, it doesn't reach the pinnacle of perfection like other recent Disney animated movies like, Wreck-It Ralph(2012) & Big Hero 6(2014). The various set pieces throughout the movie, are highly engaging & will keep you on the edge of your seat. Kids & adults will love this movie. There is a ton of heart in the film. However, one recipe missing from this movie, that make all Disney animated movies flawless, is humor. There are hardly any comedic set pieces in the movie. Even when there are, these jokes are mainly meant only for children. The sloth gag is funny at first but, it gets tedious really fast. This is a very minor flaw though. This movie is as unique as all the other Walt Disney Animation Studios & Pixar movies, to date. The highlight of the film is the suspense. This is the first animated film, that has a major mystery element throughout. The voice acting is spot on. Ginnifer Goodwin is spectacular as Judy Hopps. Jason Bateman is outstanding as Nick Wilde. Idris Elba is perfect as Chief Bogo. Jenny Slate is amazing as Bellwether. Nate Torrence is awesome as Clawhauser. Bonnie Hunt & Don Lake are good as, Bonnie Hopps & Stu Hopps, respectively. Tommy Chong is hilarious as Yax. J.K. Simmons is superb as Mayor Lionheart. Octavia Spencer is great as Mrs. Otterton. Alan Tudyk, Shakira, Raymond S.

9,2017-01-09,"Disney does it again. Another follow-your-dreams story featuring a protagonist resisting the voice of society, discovering who she is, and otherwise inspiring young audiences to do the same: to follow their dreams, to go after their ideals and desires, no matter the obstacle. For if you don't give up, and trust in your friends, you will surely succeed.Judy Hopps is a rabbit who aspires to be a policewoman, despite her parents' fear of the bigger, more predator-filled world out there in Zootopia and the absence of rabbit policemen. Unlike other Disney films, however, rather than end with the dream/identity being fulfilled, Zootopia goes beyond that and thrusts Judy into reality. Of course, being Disney, you know the good guys will triumph and everyone will be happy in the end and the bad guy turns out to be someone you've already met, you know, the usual stuff, BUT STILL, I like how Judy's dream of becoming a policewoman doesn't end there, and the plot entails a touching friendship and a message of social equality rather than the mere dream archetype. The utopia of Zootopia turns out to be darker in hue than Judy ever imagined.Zootopia is a land of mammals, predator and prey, who coexist and live as civilized beings. They're basically human but in animal form, and Disney brilliantly illustrates such a setting according to each animal's natural characteristics -- like how the streets run with multiple sizes of cars for, say, lemmings and tigers, or how the city is made up of districts for each habitat, etc. Another significant difference between Zootopia and previous Disney films is the incorporation of modern technology, such as smartphones. Watching Zootopia, you really feel like you're watching humans, just humans who look like animals on the outside. But they're human. Long ago, when the docile denizens of Zootopia were like the animals of our world -- that is, members of a natural food chain -- they decided to unite, and become civilized. In the same way, we humans have advanced in civilization and our ideals of toleration. As time passes, more and more do we see unyielding support for civil rights, first blacks, then women, now LGBT. As fellow human beings and fellow social animals, it is in our innate capacity to love and tolerate.And being Disney, the soundtrack and songs are amazing and catchy; the puns and references to popular culture are prevalent and hilarious; and the characters are well-developed and memorable. In addition, Zootopia astounded me with the quality of its animation. The studio has certainly improved since the days of Snow White.Like the featured song, ""Try Everything,"" when you fall, you can get up and try again. Our world may not be a utopia. In fact, it is far from one. But there is beauty and wonder still, and hope, and friendship, and love.

8,2017-03-06,This film is named 'Zootopia' in the US but the title was changed when it was shown in the UK. I thought it is a very good children's film. Very well animated. Colourful. Really cute animals.It is a great parable about tolerance and racism which could be seen as a mirror to the xenophobia in society today. The story is of a rabbit called Judy Hopps who overcomes diversity to become a police officer in the city of Zootropolis (Zootopia). This is a very tough city full of crime and only strong predators take charge. Judy must help to solve the case of predators disappearing around the city but needs to fight her colleagues' prejudices at the same time.The jokes are funny and the story is intriguing. The film contains lots of references to other films which will keep viewers of all ages happy (including a very funny Breaking Bad spoof).

8,2016-05-23,This was a great film. My son loved it and I'd watch it again. Obviously it's no where as good as the classic Disney films but I loved how they talked about prejudice and had so many lessons that kids can learn. I would probably watch a sequel if it were to come out but sadly I don't think it's going to be a huge movie that can withstand time. The parents of the main character were annoying but I think that was to show how some parents are viewed by their kids(haha). Overall I think that the intent behind the movie was great especially for young girls. It showed that you can be anything if you try hard enough. It shows that even the people that seem great on the outside aren't always good and that they might not have your interests at heart. Great lessons for young kids and a wonderful little world that Disney built for this movie.,161,en,great film son loved watch obviously good classic disney film loved talked prejudice many lesson kid learn would probably watch sequel come sadly think going huge movie withstand time parent main character annoying think show parent viewed kid haha overall think intent behind movie great especially young girl showed anything try hard enough show even people seem great outside always good might interest heart great lesson young kid wonderful little world disney built movie,2016-05,74,3.376541329927604
9,2018-10-10,"This Disney animation, retitled 'Zootropolis' in Europe, is set in a world without people; instead it appears that all other mammals have evolved to live like people... and not eat each other. Our protagonist is Judy Hopp, a rabbit who has always dreamt of becoming a police officer despite the fact that a rabbit has never been in the police. She exceeds expectations and becomes the first rabbit to serve in the Zootropolis Police Department. She is disappointed to be given traffic duties rather than 'proper' police-work but then an otter comes to the station saying her husband is missing. Her boss isn't interested but she insists on taking the case... he says she can do it but if she doesn't solve it in forty eight hours she will have to quit. With no access to police resources she has only one lead. This takes her to Nick Wilde; a fox who is quick to work a scam... after a little blackmail he ends up her unlikely partner and the two learn that there is a darker truth behind the disappearance; a truth that could end the peaceful coexistence of predator and prey species in Zootropolis.This film was a lot of fun... far more so than I expected. It starts well with a play featuring a young Judy which explains how predators and prey used to interact in this world but now live in peace. We then see that not all live up to the ideal. After this prologue the story proper gets started; this nicely spoofs cop-shows before the mystery gets started. This proves to be a surprisingly good mystery which is likely to keep viewers, young and old alike, guessing. There are moments that could scare younger viewers but these rarely last too long and ultimately things are resolved in a way that shouldn't leave youngsters worried. Most of the funny moments are aimed at all ages but there are some references to things children probably won't have seen such as 'The Godfather' and Breaking Bad'. As one might expect from Disney the animation is of a very high standard and the voice cast does a really good job bringing their characters to life.

10,2018-12-05,"Zootopia is both a comedy and a thriller - and a children's animated film. For a children's film, it deals with surprisingly serious topics, as it doubles as a social parody (and NO, it ISN'T left-wing - THANKFULLY). Judy Hopps is a cute bunny (who'll get annoyed if you call her that) who manages to secure her dream job of becoming a police officer in the city of Zootopia - although she faces the challenge of a boss who holds old prejudices and simply isn't interested in a bunny as a cop. However, Judy soon finds herself on a missing mammal case with a very reluctant (and just a shade on the wrong side of the law) fox which has huge implications.The animation in this film is terrific - among the best I've ever seen (alongside Finding Dory). The voice acting is good. Ginnifer Goodwin is literally PERFECT as the voice of Judy. No-one else could have done it half as good. Jason Bateman is similarly perfect as the fox, Nick Wilde. I was unsure initially about the voices of a couple less important (but still important) characters, but now I can't imagine them with another voice.

8,2017-01-01,"I'm not usually into Disney. Everything is too soft for me. I like a few, mostly because I saw them when I was a kid and they make me nostalgic. I rented this mostly because there was a sale and if you rented five movies you could have them for a week for seven euros, and it was a bargain, and I remembered my sister wanted to see this at least at one point. I did want to see this for a few reasons. One of them was that people mostly said it was great. Another was that Jason Bateman was in this movie. Now I'm not his biggest fan or anything, but I've watched enough Arrested Development to like him. So, what the hell, I watched it.I was so pleasantly surprised. What's the highest rating I've given a children's animated movie? The Lego Movie, which was awesome, and I gave it 9 / 10. Zootropolis doesn't come close to The Lego Movie, but Zootropolis is great. It is funny, and it is actually super thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what was going to happen, and what had happened, and all that. It also has just the perfect amount of scary. I'm glad I watched this.Of course there are few things that bother me like why isn't Disney using voice actors instead of some random Hollywood live action actors and actresses. Like sure, they get more viewers, but there are amazing voice actors and actresses out there, who could be magical in a movie like this. Now it's mostly like ""hey, that dude sounds familiar"" and maybe recognising one actor (Tommy Chong). It's not like the cast is bad but... why can't you use people who will definitely, absolutely do a great job?Also this movie could be a great metaphor for racism and all kind of prejudice, but it's a bit... weird. It's mixed. First it seems that everyone is pushing the prey down, but in the end everyone is awful towards PREDATORS, like hey, maybe don't be prejudice against that huge ass beast who could murder you and eat you. If you are a tiny bunny, you kind of have the right to be scared of a jaguar or whatever. Maybe you're not supposed to think about these animals as humans, but still you are kind of telling kids hey, that person who bullies you and hurts you? They have their own issues going on. Sure, they might have some issues of their own, but that doesn't make it okay...

10,2020-10-23,"This is one of Disney's most recent big hits, and it's good to see the most traditional animated film studio experiencing again some days of strength and energy, after more or less twenty years of difficulties. The film was, in all fairness, a resounding commercial and critical success, in addition to having a pertinent story about prejudices and stereotypes.The story centers on Judy Hopps, a rabbit that goes to the big city with the dream of joining the Police. But things are not easy: she is small in a universe of strong and large animals, and her companions don't take her seriously, even when she gets her first arrest. Thus, she volunteers to investigate the missing of Emmit Otterton, one among several Zootopia inhabitants who has vanished. For that, she will count on the forced collaboration of a swindler, crafty fox named Nick Wilde. And she will have to be quick, because her commander has imposed a deadline for her to present results or to resign from the force.In addition to being magnificently elaborated and animated, this film has a really good story with a pedagogical and humanistic background, insofar as it teaches us to disbelieve prejudices and preconceived ideas, as only strong men serve for the Police or Army, or all foxes are swindlers. There are so many ideas like that in our society (all blondes are unintelligent, all Frenchmen hate bathing, all Russians drink too much...) and all are unfair or unfounded prejudices. In addition to this moralizing message, the film is entertaining with good doses of comedy (the scenes with the sloths are anthological) and an engaging and interesting mystery surrounding the animals that disappeared.In addition to the characters being truly adorable, the film has a very competent voice cast, and the synchronization between animations and voices is perfect. Personally, I really liked the contributions of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Raymond S. Persi and Maurice LaMarche, the latter with an excellent imitation of Marlon Brando's hoarse voice. Musical moments are also present due to the unmistakable voice of Shakira, who was also entitled to give life to a character: the slender superstar Gazelle. It suits her!Technically, the film makes an impact due to the superb quality of animations and visual effects. Colorful, it was so clearly designed and beautifully edited an mixed that animations and characters took on an almost palpable realism. The conception of that city, with all its distinct but interconnected biomes allowing a better perception of how animals connect to their natural environment, also deserves an applause. Finally, I have to praise to Michael Giacchino's excellent soundtrack and the original song ""Try Everything"".",441,en,one disney recent big hit good see traditional animated film studio experiencing day strength energy less twenty year difficulty film fairness resounding commercial critical success addition pertinent story prejudice stereotype story center judy hopps rabbit go big city dream joining police thing easy small universe strong large animal companion take seriously even get first arrest thus volunteer investigate missing emmit otterton one among several zootopia inhabitant vanished count forced collaboration swindler crafty fox named nick wilde quick commander imposed deadline present result resign force addition magnificently elaborated animated film really good story pedagogical humanistic background insofar teach u disbelieve prejudice preconceived idea strong men serve police army fox swindler many idea like society blonde unintelligent frenchman hate bathing russian drink much unfair unfounded prejudice addition moralizing message film entertaining good dos comedy scene sloth anthological engaging interesting mystery surrounding animal disappeared addition character truly adorable film competent voice cast synchronization animation voice perfect personally really liked contribution ginnifer goodwin jason bateman idris elba raymond persi maurice lamarche latter excellent imitation marlon brando hoarse voice musical moment also present due unmistakable voice shakira also entitled give life character slender superstar gazelle suit technically film make impact due superb quality animation visual effect colorful clearly designed beautifully edited mixed animation character took almost palpable realism conception city distinct interconnected biome allowing better perception animal connect natural environment also deserves applause finally praise michael giacchino excellent soundtrack original song try everything,2020-10,238,2.679970845819633
10,2017-08-06,"Zootopia surprised me a lot, it's one of the best animated movies of 2016! This is definitely a movie not only for kids but for adults as well. Actually, I think that adults will appreciate this film way more than their children.First of all, the story. How intriguing, captivating and surprising can an animated film be? Well, the levels are really high in Zootopia! It's constantly entertaining, fast-paced (except on a hilarious slow scene with a sloth), the mystery surrounding the case it's really interesting and the comparisons done with our real world are so well placed. Everything is addressed: from stereotypes to racism going through corruption and even drugs.Judy and Nick are amazing! They work so well together and it's beautiful to watch how they decided to follow completely different paths, even when their pasts are very similar. Both of them transmit such an important message of being whatever we dream of, not giving up and not showing your weak side. I had a blast watching this two fighting against crime and all of the stereotypes surrounding our world nowadays.It's really well animated with delightful details and with great supporting characters. Plus, some twists in the third act and a lot of funny scenes keep us entertained for the whole runtime. My only minor issue with this film are the constant exposition scenes throughout the movie, something I can understand since this is a movie mostly advertised for children, but it still bugged me a little bit, especially the opening scene.This movie is still awesome, it has great characters, a super interesting plot, some beautiful messages both for us and the kids, a really cool soundtrack by Michael Giacchino and two protagonists that are just amazing!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",299,en,zootopia surprised lot one best animated movie definitely movie kid adult well actually think adult appreciate film way child first story intriguing captivating surprising animated film well level really high zootopia constantly entertaining fast paced except hilarious slow scene sloth mystery surrounding case really interesting comparison done real world well placed everything addressed stereotype racism going corruption even drug judy nick amazing work well together beautiful watch decided follow completely different path even past similar transmit important message whatever dream giving showing weak side blast watching two fighting crime stereotype surrounding world nowadays really well animated delightful detail great supporting character plus twist third act lot funny scene keep u entertained whole runtime minor issue film constant exposition scene throughout movie something understand since movie mostly advertised child still bugged little bit especially opening scene movie still awesome great character super interesting plot beautiful message u kid really cool soundtrack michael giacchino two protagonist amazing msb review like review please follow blog,2017-08,162,3.080204022583794

10,2016-06-22,"Okay so I have always been a huge fan of animation. There are soo many great animated films out there both that are dark and some that are really lighthearted and funny and this is no different than those. This movie works in all cylinders. This will be the most fun of any animated film I have ever watched. This jokes are smart and interesting. The dialogue is pretty compelling. And the world building her is perfect. It really does feel like our world, but it just at one point was being inhabited by animals.This movie really has a strong theme of racism going on throughout it as well and it does it in such a cool way without feeling like it is beating you over the head with its message. This movie is fun, cool and very inventive.

The music was awesome and really mashed well with the animal city setting and Shakira's ""try everything"" was really good and the train and concert scenes gave me goosebumps. The characters were probably my favorite thing of the movie. Every single character was fantastic , and the two leads were godlike and fit each other perfectly, Judy hoops was so cute and pure hearth but at the same time really strong willed and ready to learn and improve and Nick Wilde what can I say... Probably my favorite character EVER. It felt so real , the personality fitted so well the animal of the fox and Jason Bateman was probably the best to dub Nick Wilde , it felt like the lead character was based on Jason more than the opposite. Overall this was a fantastic experience and it left a big joy in my hearth. Will be soooooooo hard for Disney or any other company to beat that but I hope they will do it and I can't wait for it, meanwhile this movie set an incredible achievement for Walt Disney studios and really made me smile in a sad and difficult period.

8,2016-03-13,"An atypical Disney studio animation comes out in March, ZOOTOPIA is a spunkily crowd-pleasing roller-coaster of gags, fun and wisdom, expediently taps into the anthropomorphic mammal fauna as a mirror of our own society, where the minority of predators is persecuted for their brutal nature which is designed by their DNAs, is it right to sacrifice the rights of a minority party just to ensure that a majority preys will feel safer? This is the lesson every kid (sometimes, the adults too) who is watching this picture should learn, so it is enormously pleasing to see Disney is judicious enough to be the torchbearer, to instill the notion of a harmonious society with co-existing diversity to children is an immeasurable deed can benefit future generations and promise a brighter future.Our protagonist is the rabbit Judy Hopps (Goodwin), who is determined to be the first bunny cop in the police force, against all odds, she makes it and starts to work in Zootopia. In spite of being belittled by her boss Chef Bogo (Elba), Judy befriends with a con artist, the fox Nick Wilde (Bateman), together they must solve a mysterious case of missing predators. Then, an ostensible triumph prompts Judy's politically uncorrected speech, which inadvertently incites the mass hostility towards the predators, so eventually, it is down to Judy and Nick to debunk a conspiracy theory carried out by the meekest species.The plot thickens halfway through, which indicates the story has more affinity to a Pixar-esque criterion than a common lower-age-aiming pap, and up to the segment where Judy apologises to Nick for her blunder, the film pulls off a fairly emotional catharsis, then rounds off with a bromide to reveal the (till that point) unsurprising culprit.The technical work is certainly above-par, Oscar-worthy to say the least. A ream of unorthodox characters, running the gamut from the limelight-stealing DMV officer sloth Flash to a rip-roaring Mr. Big pays homage to THE GODFATHER franchise, contradictions galore, but never overstay their welcome.

10,2016-03-05,"Zootopia is directed by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, and Jared Bush, and stars Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps, a bunny rabbit that lives in a world in which animals are civilized, and live in cities together. She dreams of being a police officer in a big city called Zootopia, even though all of her peers, including her parents, try to keep her under the ""status quo,"" in which she is just a simple carrot farmer. She disagrees with this, and becomes a police officer, yet realizes that she was handed a case bigger than she could imagine; a case she must solve with the help of a sly fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).To begin, Zootopia is hands down the best Disney film since The Lion King (1994). Everything about this movie was utterly amazing, and surprised me in so many ways. The underlying tone and themes, the characters, the plot, the voice acting, and the animation. First, the primary themes in the film are actually very dark and deep. There's symbolism of racism, sexism, drugs, and even what American is supposed to stand for, yet fails at doing. All of these themes play across perfectly, and are very surprising in a children's movie.The characters and plot in this film are both equally perfect. The plot shows that anybody can be anything, and the characters describe this so very well. All of the characters are very interesting, and three-dimensional in ways that are subtle, yet obvious once the film all come together. Each character has a great arc throughout the movie, and learns a lesson through experiences and other characters they meet.The voice acting is this film is rare. I mean this by saying the the voice acting is absolutely perfect. There isn't a single flaw with the acting, and each actor portrays their character amazingly. Jason Bateman as Nick Wilde was a perfect casting choice, although it didn't seem that way prior to viewing the film. Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps was also amazing, and brought the character to life in such a way that is near impossible for an animated movie. Idris Elba as Police Chief Bobo is also fantastic. He depicts a hardened police officer is a way I never would have thought of. Even Shakira does really good in this movie, which is something I never thought I would say.The animation in Zootopia is also top notch. Every tiny, seemingly insignificant movement, by any and every character, flows flawlessly with the background, and looks absolutely perfect. All of the animation is ultimately impeccable.Overall, Zootopia is an amazing film that children will love seeing, along with their parents or older siblings. It will easily be known as a Disney classic in 20 years or so, due to the animation, characters, acting, and intense plot.

9,2016-03-06,"Walt Disney Animation Studios, in the decade from 1989 to 1999, produced some of the Western world's most cherished and culturally significant films: The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, the Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, and Tarzan. Not only were these films artistic masterpieces, but they in many ways captured the zeitgeist of their era - the ""Disney Renaissance"".Following a tumultuous transition to computer animation, since the release of Tangled in 2010, we are currently amidst Disney's triumphant return to form as an animation studio peerless in its technical animation and narrative prowess. Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and now Zootopia, all demonstrate the studio's remarkable ability to combine spectacular visual pieces of art with storytelling that both inform and are informed by the cultural dialogue of the time.Frozen proved to be a cultural phenomenon for this reason, and deservedly so. Yet with Zootopia, Disney has surpassed anything it has previously produced during this new post-Tangled ""Golden Era"" - its computer animation has never been so breathtaking, its writing has never been so on point, and its messaging has never been so timely.In terms of its artistic wizardry, Zootopia surpasses the high bars set by Disney's previous work Big Hero 6 and Dreamworks's How to Train Your Dragon 2. The environments are rendered with such sumptuous detail and inspired creativity that, counter-intuitively, one almost forgets you're watching a computer animated film. The movie does not strive towards photo-realism - the aesthetic is definitely stylized - and yet many scenes exude so much detail that they almost become photo realistic. The introductory tour through the city of Zootopia, as the camera speeds through its various biomes, is a marvel of animation and world-building. Combined with the smart and often surprisingly mature dialogue, Zootopia very may well be a brilliant live-action cop mystery/drama.The dynamic detective duo of Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde serves as the narrative anchor and emotional core of the film. Voiced perfectly by Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman respectively, the chemistry between the two supplies their friendly relationship with much of its emotional weight and attractiveness. Dialogue throughout the film is clever and often uproariously funny, easily sustaining interest in the movie's story.On these grounds alone, Zootopia would be an excellent entry into Disney's repertoire. The film's underlying message, however, propels it to even greater heights. Animated movies are no strangers to anthropomorphic animals, but Zootopia leverages this device to its full potential and asks the viewer to consider important questions about race relations, prejudice, and stereotyping without his or her real world preconceptions and associated baggage. Released in the first quarter of 2016, this discussion could not be more important given given the politics and current affairs of both the United States and Europe.The easy course for this discussion would have been to follow the struggles of a minority group within Zootopia's inhabitants, which then would map onto a real world disadvantaged group and the challenges they face. In a real show of ingenuity in creative writing, Zootopia avoids this simplistic path completely. There is no clear-cut oppressor and oppressed, no abuser and victim, no privileged and disadvantaged. Instead, the movie wants us to think about the core challenges presented by prejudice and discrimination on their own terms within a world where, much like ours, such distinctions between groups often can be highly fluid and contextual.The predators of Zootopia struggle to escape their prehistorical roots as the oppressing class of species in a universe where the animal kingdom has biologically evolved far beyond this - appeals to ""biology"" in favour of the dominance of predators are just as flawed as their real-world racial parallels. Yet simultaneously, predators are also a minority within Zootopia, and are shown to be equally capable of being the victims of prejudice, stereotyping, media sensationalism, and dog-whistle politics. Zootopia shows just how complex, messy, and intractable these conflicts are. Things simply cannot be distilled down to, ""Here's the dominant group, here's the group that they're discriminating against. Look how awful it is..."" With this sharp commentary, Zootopia is the product of Disney firing on all cylinders. If there was still doubt as to whether we indeed are in the midst of a resurgent Golden Era for the studio, this film firmly quashes it.",709,en,walt disney animation studio decade produced western world cherished culturally significant film little mermaid beauty beast aladdin lion king pocahontas mulan tarzan film artistic masterpiece many way captured zeitgeist era disney renaissance following tumultuous transition computer animation since release tangled currently amidst disney triumphant return form animation studio peerless technical animation narrative prowess tangled wreck ralph frozen zootopia demonstrate studio remarkable ability combine spectacular visual piece art storytelling inform informed cultural dialogue time frozen proved cultural phenomenon reason deservedly yet zootopia disney surpassed anything previously produced new post tangled golden era computer animation never breathtaking writing never point messaging never timely term artistic wizardry zootopia surpasses high bar set disney previous work big hero dreamworks train dragon environment rendered sumptuous detail inspired creativity counter intuitively one almost forgets watching computer animated film movie strive towards photo realism aesthetic definitely stylized yet many scene exude much detail almost become photo realistic introductory tour city zootopia camera speed various biome marvel animation world building combined smart often surprisingly mature dialogue zootopia may well brilliant live action cop mystery drama dynamic detective duo judy hopps nick wilde serf narrative anchor emotional core film voiced perfectly ginnifer goodwin jason bateman respectively chemistry two supply friendly relationship much emotional weight attractiveness dialogue throughout film clever often uproariously funny easily sustaining interest movie story ground alone zootopia would excellent entry disney repertoire film underlying message however propels even greater height animated movie stranger anthropomorphic animal zootopia leverage device full potential asks viewer consider important question race relation prejudice stereotyping without real world preconception associated baggage released first quarter discussion could important given given politics current affair united state europe easy course discussion would follow struggle minority group within zootopia inhabitant would map onto real world disadvantaged group challenge face real show ingenuity creative writing zootopia avoids simplistic path completely clear cut oppressor oppressed abuser victim privileged disadvantaged instead movie want u think core challenge presented prejudice discrimination term within world much like distinction group often highly fluid contextual predator zootopia struggle escape prehistorical root oppressing class specie universe animal kingdom biologically evolved far beyond appeal biology favour dominance predator flawed real world racial parallel yet simultaneously predator also minority within zootopia shown equally capable victim prejudice stereotyping medium sensationalism dog whistle politics zootopia show complex messy intractable conflict thing simply cannot distilled dominant group group discriminating look awful sharp commentary zootopia product disney firing cylinder still doubt whether indeed midst resurgent golden era studio film firmly quashes,2016-03,411,2.6321703912811554

A city where all animals live among each other; predator and prey. However, things are not all fluffy clouds when not everyone is so friendly. Meanwhile, some citizens are going missing and there might be more to it than just it being a strange issue. As Hopps learns this, she teams up with a street fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) to see what she can dig up. The plot itself behind the story is nothing that breaks new ground, but it's the overall message and themes behind the film which are so poignant.Judy Hopps is a bunny, an animal considered by many as prey in the animal kingdom. This however does not stop her from becoming what she desires most. Even though her parents were very much satisfied being the status quo. Too each their own per scenario, but the idea of taking a risk and stepping out of the comfort zone to embrace logical positive change should not be something that is feared. Fear is unfortunately one of the strongest emotions and it can wreak havoc among not just a single individual, but a society as well. What's great about the characters is that focused writing. Even Nick has a backstory that allows audiences to get a better understanding of his perspective as well. This again, all goes back to the getting to know people and not assuming things based on similarities to others.As for characters and the actors that play them, it is quite interesting to see who plays what. Ginnifer Goodwin who's known for doing Snow White in the Once Upon a Time series has made a lasting impression as Hopps. Jason Bateman known for being in all kinds of comedies plays a great foil to that of the straight performance from Goodwin. Idris Elba plays Chief Bogo, Hopps' boss. Jenny Slate plays Assistant Bellwether, as her character would call a glorified secretary position to actual Mayor Lionheart played by J. K. Simmons. There's also Nate Torrence playing Clawhauser, a donut eating cheetah. There's Octavia Spencer playing the wife of a missing animal, Alan Tudyk as a weasel, Raymond S. Persi as Flash the slow moving sloth and even Maurice LaMarche in a special role that won't be disclosed.The animation is another great component to this movie. Supported by animation supervisors who have worked on Treasure Planet (2002), Big Hero 6 (2014), Paperman (2012) and Frozen (2013), it's no surprise the visuals are creative, colorful and well detailed. Credit also should be given to Nathan Warner listed as cinematographer for designing the unique layout location that is Zootopia. How that architecture would ever become a reality today is big question. Lastly the musical score composed by Michael Giacchino is an added bonus. Unfortunately, he did not create a main theme for the movie which he easily could've done with Shakira's ""Try Everything"" pop song. But that doesn't mean his music isn't effective. Having worked on The Incredibles (2004) and Star Trek (2009), how could it not be worth a listen?Plot wise, it's not something people haven't seen before. However, it's the way that it's worked into the execution and relies heavily on the themes and morals it wants to get across is what makes it special. Everything from the characters, music and animation make this an entertaining family film.",739,en,lesson life people crystal clear growing one determine except paint broad stroke everyone opinion different angle life experience said important try listen side coming film came still relevant much mislabeling going society people disconnected ever believe dialog need whether agreement made great anyone reasonable age watch movie take message away written jared bush phil johnston directed rich moore byron howard worked popular wreck ralph story small town bunny named judy hopps ginnifer goodwin making way become police officer place called zootopia city animal live among predator prey however thing fluffy cloud everyone friendly meanwhile citizen going missing might strange issue hopps learns team street fox named nick wilde jason bateman see dig plot behind story nothing break new ground overall message theme behind film poignant judy hopps bunny animal considered many prey animal kingdom however stop becoming desire even though parent much satisfied status quo per scenario idea taking risk stepping comfort zone embrace logical positive change something feared fear unfortunately one strongest emotion wreak havoc among single individual society well great character focused writing even nick backstory allows audience get better understanding perspective well go back getting know people assuming thing based similarity others character actor play quite interesting see play ginnifer goodwin known snow white upon time series made lasting impression hopps jason bateman known kind comedy play great foil straight performance goodwin idris elba play chief bogo hopps bos jenny slate play assistant bellwether character would call glorified secretary position actual mayor lionheart played j k simmons also nate torrence playing clawhauser donut eating cheetah octavia spencer playing wife missing animal alan tudyk weasel raymond persi flash slow moving sloth even maurice lamarche special role disclosed animation another great component movie supported animation supervisor worked treasure planet big hero paperman frozen surprise visuals creative colorful well detailed credit also given nathan warner listed cinematographer designing unique layout location zootopia architecture would ever become reality today big question lastly musical score composed michael giacchino added bonus unfortunately create main theme movie easily could done shakira try everything pop song mean music effective worked incredibles star trek could worth listen plot wise something people seen however way worked execution relies heavily theme moral want get across make special everything character music animation make entertaining family film,2021-05,377,2.479522334483842

Inside, animals are completely unclothed, posed in ways that are clearly suggestive, and there's even mention of a ""pleasure pool."" This scene feels sexualized and completely unnecessary for the story.What is this doing in a movie aimed at children? It's outrageous that a company like Disney would think this is acceptable. Kids watch these films to be inspired, entertained, and uplifted - not to be exposed to adult humor and innuendo that has no place in a G-rated setting.Parents deserve to know that this scene exists.

9,2020-05-06,"Yes it's a children's movie. But that's the beauty of Zootopia or any Pixar movie as a matter of fact. It never fails to capture the true essence of life that can be easily enjoyed by both young and old. These intricately designed movies, tailored to fit everyone's interests, are architecture-d with perfection which is clearly evidently from each and every frame.
Zootopia is set in a world where predators and prey live in harmony. Judy is a small town rabbit and falls in the latter category naturally. She has big ambitions of being a police officer in the big city of Zootopia. The movie navigates through all the trials and tribulations she faces on her journey after going to Zootopia and having achieved her dream.
Judy is one of us- overzealous having fulfilled her lifelong dream despite the ridicules she received from everyone around her and quickly disheartened
after the reality sets in. It's not all sunshine and rainbows. This is what sets Judy apart from the rest of us. She doesn't forgo what she believes in even when the world says otherwise. Ultimately, she proves herself right.
The characters are likable and add to the quirk of the movie. The sidekicks were as well thought as the main characters.
Every scene in the movie has a role to play and has been crafted seamlessly to fit in the bigger picture like every piece fits the puzzle.
The details are mind-blowing and is the product of sheer hard work put into it. Words fall short to describe the wonderful animation Pixar tirelessly serves to its viewers on and on.
The storytelling is commendable which certainly adds to the viewing experience.
As a whole it's one of those feel good movies that urges you to continue to hope despite the challenges- a clichéd life lesson given by many but adopted by none.

9,2025-11-24,"Zootopia remains one of Disney's most inventive and compelling animated films, a movie that blends humor, mystery, and social commentary with a level of sophistication that's rare for family entertainment. From the moment Judy Hopps decides she's going to be the first bunny police officer in Zootopia, the film finds its spark. It's a story rooted in determination and optimism, and the filmmakers take full advantage of the premise to build a world that feels endlessly alive and surprisingly thoughtful. You go into the movie expecting something cute and fun, but what you get is a multilayered adventure that hits harder than anticipated.The plot unfolds like a clever detective story, slowly teasing a conspiracy that keeps you guessing at every turn. What makes the narrative so exciting is how it constantly challenges your assumptions. You think you know exactly what's happening, but the film keeps twisting the truth just enough to keep you engaged. It uses the mystery structure not just for entertainment, but to explore themes of bias, fear, and societal division without ever feeling preachy. The writing is sharp, fast, and meaningful, and it rewards both kids and adults without talking down to anyone.Judy Hopps is one of Disney's strongest protagonists in years. Her energy, heart, and unstoppable belief in herself give the film its emotional backbone. She's flawed in all the right ways-hopeful to a fault, determined beyond reason, and capable of making mistakes that feel authentic. Her journey from naive dreamer to a more grounded, self-aware officer is executed with sincerity, never losing the charm that makes her such an easy character to root for.Nick Wilde, of course, steals the show every chance he gets. His sly humor, dry wit, and layered backstory make him the perfect counterpart to Judy. The chemistry between these two characters elevates the film to a whole new level, creating one of Disney's most memorable duos. Their banter feels natural, their trust builds slowly and believably, and their friendship becomes the true heart of the movie. When they're on screen together, the film is at its strongest.The world-building in Zootopia is exceptional, showcasing Disney's ability to create environments that are visually striking and narratively functional. Every district-Rainforest, Tundra, Sahara Square, Little Rodentia-feels fully realized and intentionally designed. The animation is vibrant and full of detail, and the humor sprinkled throughout the city's culture and infrastructure adds to the movie's charm without ever distracting from the story. It's an example of world-building that enhances every single scene rather than just decorating it.Zootopia succeeds because it isn't afraid to be more than a typical animated comedy. It tackles real issues through the lens of animals while maintaining enough heart and humor to keep things accessible. It's a film that entertains effortlessly, but also sticks with you long after the credits roll. Disney delivered something bold, clever, and emotionally resonant, and it remains one of the most rewatchable movies in their recent lineup.

She wants to be a cop, but everyone tells her that she hasn't got what's needed to become one simply because she is a rabbit. Beside that personal issue which has been seen a lot in recent Disney movies, there is a refreshing social comment on how society is full of prejudice, here exemplified by predator and prey. That is a brilliant metaphore!And there is no stone left unturned in the world of Zootopia! So much attention has been payed to details in every part of the city! Go watch it for yourself, otherwise I would spoil it!But such small things as how Judy Hopps shows her emotional state by how her ears are is one of the great details of the animation.

Happily, Disney ensures this fictional world is recognizable still, with its true to life depiction of features & peculiarities.Apart from its touch of eye candy, Zootopia's writing deserves a thousand mentions, as it is quite possibly its most stellar asset. Judy Hopps & Nick Wilde for instance, are well envisioned, lovable characters that are given rich backstories & grounded personalities & even flaws, that makes them a breeze to root for. On the other hand, its mature messages that touches on stereotypes, prejudice & how politics weave through these, was a pleasant, welcome surprise. Amazingly, Zootopia veers away from being preachy despite its themes, as its brand of comedy & light hearted fun remain its main draw.

What sets Zootopia apart though is how well it treats the issues and how the themes apply not only to issues of racial bias, but to all forms of intolerance of any number of personal traits. The themes of inclusion extend to all groups or persons who might feel othered for any reason.Zootopia also features strong themes of believing in yourself and in others. Of breaking out of the mould of what the world tells you are your limits or how high you should aim. Or even the value of having any notion of reaching after your aspirations at all, instead of settling for the familiar well-worn path of your parents and those around you.

What's genius about this movie is that they take an exact replica of our society and transform it into an anthropomorphic city called Zootopia where everybody lives in perfect harmony. And like our society where we deal with issues like racism, sexism, and other topics, they take those issues and pack it into Zootopia, while at the same time keeping it entertaining for adults and children.

Eg diversity and inclusion is certainly key themes. On a number of occasions reference is made to the fact that the population is ninety percent prey & ten percent predators. This could relate to a human population afraid of minority groups as threats. Another instance was where Hopps was called cute and she responded angrily saying ""no one calls me cute, apart from other bunnies"". That could be from when black people call each other by the N word and only other black people can use the term. There's also a part where a shop refuses to sell serves an animal saying that it's an elephant only store. That seemed very much like Segregation. It works on different levels meaning there's something for everyone. And even if just watched it from a surface perspective, it's a sweet story about bullying and acceptance. Each character has their own personality and problems, and that's shared during the whole movie.

9,2020-09-17,"""Zootopia"", a dream set in a city where predators and prey live respectively in peacefully, is an entertaining, flawlessly planned children's film. This movie gives us a message. Zootopia is an extraordinarily fun and engaging film from Walt Disney Animation. Furthermore, the illustrators work superbly at making exciting character plans for many various types of creatures.
Zootopia is one of the best-animated movies up to date because of it's stunning animation. It's pleasant, clever, and truly smart. I appreciated the primary characters, and I even thought about them!
Bunny Hops, a small town bunny who's informed that she can't be a cop in Zootopia on the grounds that there will never be been a bunny police officer. The work will, in general, be finished by predators and huge herbivores, like an Ox that is become a police chief, voiced by Idris Elba. enduring police training in any case and gets allocated to meter maid duty, to the help of her parents. Her parents repellent the fox. They had a valid justification to give her fox repellent. the fox is one of the rabbit's enemy and when Judy was youngster, a fox cornered her at a province reasonable, offended her for being a rabbit, and sliced her face with his paw.
The story follows Judy forces Nick into helping her by secretly recording his fee to tax avoidance, having found out from photograph proof that Nick was the last to see Emmitt. Judy collaborates with Nick to find the missing Emmitt, and together they wind up see-through a hazy plotting. Judy praised Nick for illuminating the case, has become companions with Nick and requests that he join the ZPD as her partner. And at the end, Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner. Featuring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, and J.K. Simmons, the voice cast is particularly acceptable and gives some extraordinary exhibitions; making truly beautiful characters.
Judy learns some hard fact as she digs more into the secret, and also watchers will, as well. Being civilized doesn't mean pressure and immorality is disappeared. Additionally, achieving positive change isn't as simple as it appears. However, she is reminded by a good-natured yet microaggressive cheetah that ""only a rabbit can call another rabbit cute"". And also Judy regrets after her sincere intention is gone wrong, she said, ""I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it.""
However, the composing is weighty in its messages about resistance, the legislative issues of fear, and not generalizing others. There's additionally a touch of disarray in how this universe of humanized creatures functions.
It's still Disney, however, and it closes joyfully and absents a lot of transparency. There's plentiful space given for prey like Judy to apologize to unreasonably charged predators, like fox amigo and for everybody to develop.
Lastly, it teaches us, ""anyone can be anything"".

9,2020-01-22,"""You probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny 'cute,' but when other animals do it, it's a little..."" inappropriate? condescending? presumptuous? This is now the privilege of insider vs. outsider is transformed from the real world into the animated world of Judy Hopps as she experiences prejudice and ""species profiling"" in a society where everyone is supposed to be beyond that.In Zootopia, enlightened predators and prey live harmoniously and safely. They recognized the animal instincts that were keeping them in the pre-stone-age, and have evolved socially into a perfect world. Animals still retain all of the funny, quirky, and (forgive me) cute qualities that we in the real world have come to love and expect. This is where many of the sight and personality gags come from that propel the viewer in to understanding and even accepting the premise. These animals may be woke, but they still do the darndest things. However, the society of this animal kingdom is a utopia of equality and acceptance. Or so they say.Unlike a live action film where acting, lighting, camera work, and sets create the visual experience, in an animated movie, every pixel of every frame requires composition and creation. The production work on this movie rises to the highest standards available to date. Consider the panoramic wide angle shots of the lead character travelling from her small farming community to the big city. From phenomenal camera angles to extensive detail in the natural surfaces of fur, leaves, sand and snow, to the masterfully generated emotional detail on the face of a bunny, this scene astounds the viewer with a super-reality that makes fantastical sense.The 9-person writing staff led by Byron Howard begins with the standard police procedural (with Idiris Elba voicing the hard-boiled Chief Bogo), adds the typical ""unlikely"" character (in this case a bunny cop voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), includes the villain with a heart of gold (Jason Bateman as the fox, Nick Wilde), and then mixes it all up with the deep seated distrust of ""the other"" to show the audience that it takes a lot more than government regulation for us all to just get along.A viewer might argue that the movie depends upon the audience buying into the very stereotypes that are being decried. You are expected to ""get"" that the mayor with his condescending attitude and thirst for power is best represented by a lion; that the police chief with his arrogant indifference to other perspectives or individual potential is best represented by a stoically arrogant water buffalo; that the slower than slow government workers at the Department of Motor Vehicles are literally giant sloths; that a new age health spa stoner is best represented by a llama (instead of a koala?). But it is only when we are lulled into acknowledging the simple fact that there is more than ""just a hint of truth to animal stereotypes"" that the most surprising plot twists can have their strongest effects.We have all seen saccharine animated films where the ant saves the colony, or the bully toy learns to play nice, or the bee starts a labor union (or something like that). This animated feature does not insult our intelligence, but it doesn't preach either. It takes a real world issue that has life for death implications and amplifies it to the degree that it is impossible to ignore, then reveals how it is really much more complicated than we simple humans really understand.For some good fun at the expense of our animal friends, some thoughtful experimentation into social criticism, and some incredible visual production, you can't do much better than Zootopia.",606,en,probably know bunny call another bunny cute animal little inappropriate condescending presumptuous privilege insider v outsider transformed real world animated world judy hopps experience prejudice specie profiling society everyone supposed beyond zootopia enlightened predator prey live harmoniously safely recognized animal instinct keeping pre stone age evolved socially perfect world animal still retain funny quirky forgive cute quality real world come love expect many sight personality gag come propel viewer understanding even accepting premise animal may woke still darndest thing however society animal kingdom utopia equality acceptance say unlike live action film acting lighting camera work set create visual experience animated movie every pixel every frame requires composition creation production work movie rise highest standard available date consider panoramic wide angle shot lead character travelling small farming community big city phenomenal camera angle extensive detail natural surface fur leaf sand snow masterfully generated emotional detail face bunny scene astounds viewer super reality make fantastical sense person writing staff led byron howard begin standard police procedural idiris elba voicing hard boiled chief bogo add typical unlikely character case bunny cop voiced ginnifer goodwin includes villain heart gold jason bateman fox nick wilde mix deep seated distrust show audience take lot government regulation u get along viewer might argue movie depends upon audience buying stereotype decried expected get mayor condescending attitude thirst power best represented lion police chief arrogant indifference perspective individual potential best represented stoically arrogant water buffalo slower slow government worker department motor vehicle literally giant sloth new age health spa stoner best represented llama instead koala lulled acknowledging simple fact hint truth animal stereotype surprising plot twist strongest effect seen saccharine animated film ant save colony bully toy learns play nice bee start labor union something like animated feature insult intelligence preach either take real world issue life death implication amplifies degree impossible ignore reveals really much complicated simple human really understand good fun expense animal friend thoughtful experimentation social criticism incredible visual production much better zootopia,2020-01,327,2.728097506521659

10,2021-09-20,"Disney's new animated feature, ""Zootopia,"" centers on a metropolis that is home to many anthropomorphic animals, big or small. New police department recruit Judy Hopps is the first rabbit officer to join the force, but she soon faces the challenges that occur, such as being considered too small and her capabilities being doubted by police chief Bogo. However, a conspiracy involving the disappearance of different predatory civilians forces Hopps to team up with a sly fox named Nick Wilde. As they begin to uncover the mystery, they also begin to learn more about each other and overcome their differences to work together and save the day.The timing couldn't be more perfect for ""Zootopia,"" since its themes about overcoming prejudice and stereotypes, realizing life isn't as perfect as one may think, and making great achievements in spite of one's differences or deficiencies, are displayed with a real degree of honesty and genuine emotion. These undertones are particularly evident in the backstories of the leads, Hopps and Nick. This might be the best Disney film to explore the issues that often plague modern society, and once the plot unravels, the audience starts to get the sense that things are not always what they may appear to be. In an effective visual metaphor, the animals are anthropomorphic when walking on two legs and wearing clothes, but revert back to being animalistic once they are forced to walk on all fours. The story is structured very neatly as well and never misses a beat, even at the revelation of certain twists. Some of the funniest scenes in the film include a naturist animal club led by a spiritual yak named Yax, a DMV operated by sloths that include the ironically-named Flash, and an homage to ""The Godfather,"" as if it featured an Arctic shrew in the lead.The animation of ""Zootopia"" looks absolutely stunning, as does the visual design. There is so much emotion and energy prevalent in the characters, especially Hopps, Nick, and the DMV sloths, that it supports the movie in terms of its artistic and socially-conscious appeal. The different districts in Zootopia are named and designed to reflect the different species of animals that live there, including Little Rodentia for the rodent residents, Tundratown for lower temperature mammals, and Sahara Square for camels and other desert animals. The film also features a large cast, including Ginnifer Goodwin as Hopps, who brings a great deal of sincerity and optimism to the role, a perfect counterpart to Jason Bateman's cynical and anti-authoritarian turn as Nick Wilde. Tommy Chong, as Yax, brings back memories of the Cheech & Chong days, while Idris Elba gives off a stern demeanor playing police chief Bogo, J. K. Simmons shows off gruff enthusiasm as Mayor Lionheart, and superstar Shakira cameos as a singing gazelle sensation. Additional cast members include Octavia Spencer, Jenny Slate, Nate Torrence, Bonnie Hunt, and Alan Tudyk.With its relevant themes, well-developed characters, and invigorating moments of suspense, ""Zootopia"" could be considered a modern classic in the Disney canon.",502,en,disney new animated feature zootopia center metropolis home many anthropomorphic animal big small new police department recruit judy hopps first rabbit officer join force soon face challenge occur considered small capability doubted police chief bogo however conspiracy involving disappearance different predatory civilian force hopps team sly fox named nick wilde begin uncover mystery also begin learn overcome difference work together save day timing perfect zootopia since theme overcoming prejudice stereotype realizing life perfect one may think making great achievement spite one difference deficiency displayed real degree honesty genuine emotion undertone particularly evident backstories lead hopps nick might best disney film explore issue often plague modern society plot unravels audience start get sense thing always may appear effective visual metaphor animal anthropomorphic walking two leg wearing clothes revert back animalistic forced walk four story structured neatly well never miss beat even revelation certain twist funniest scene film include naturist animal club led spiritual yak named yax dmv operated sloth include ironically named flash homage godfather featured arctic shrew lead animation zootopia look absolutely stunning visual design much emotion energy prevalent character especially hopps nick dmv sloth support movie term artistic socially conscious appeal different district zootopia named designed reflect different specie animal live including little rodentia rodent resident tundratown lower temperature mammal sahara square camel desert animal film also feature large cast including ginnifer goodwin hopps brings great deal sincerity optimism role perfect counterpart jason bateman cynical anti authoritarian turn nick wilde tommy chong yax brings back memory cheech chong day idris elba give stern demeanor playing police chief bogo j k simmons show gruff enthusiasm mayor lionheart superstar shakira cameo singing gazelle sensation additional cast member include octavia spencer jenny slate nate torrence bonnie hunt alan tudyk relevant theme well developed character invigorating moment suspense zootopia could considered modern classic disney canon,2021-09,302,2.4091279322014447
8,2016-03-05,"It seems that Disney studios continues to partake in a civil war between their two animation companies. Today Walt Disney Animation studios' puts out another work entitled Zootopia, to attempt to add another Oscar worthy film to their ranks. With all the hype and build up, I looked forward to being entertained by another masterpiece from their studio. Yet the question ""Is it worth the trip to theater?"" may be ringing through your ears. So once again I'm going to give you my input and help you decide the answer to that question. Thereforelet's get to it.Like every Disney movie you can bet that the animation is excellent, and Zootopia is no exception. The cast of anthropomorphized animals fluidly moves about the screen in a human like manner as they live their lives throughout the fictional city, capturing the grace and dexterity of the homo sapiens they are modeled after. Even more impressive is seeing our animals in the primal state, as their anatomy is fully captured in spectacular detail.But animation is only one part of the magic of Zootopia. The design of the world is amazing, a perfect blend of modernized civilization and animal ecosystems. Zootpia's residential sections emphasize certain architectural styles that personify the particular mood of the area (e.g. Icy cold tundra as a front for the Mafia or the serene yet wild energy of the jungle villas.) All these details were brilliantly colored and shaded, bringing out the emotion of each scene, but still maintaining the whimsical nature of a Disney film. While I didn't see the movie in 3-D, I can certainly see this beautiful world being further stunning.While the design of the movie is enough to pull you into the theater let's talk about the story and comedy of the movie next. Disney always has the quirky, unique ideas that manage to imprint on our minds and make us fall in love with it. For Zootopia that main story is a mystery centered on disappearing animals across the city. This mystery established the suspense of the story, keeping me intrigued throughout the tale as to how deep the ""rabbit"" hole went. The genius of the movie though is bringing two other stories into the fold and integrating them into the plot. These plots are character-developing moments that give our characters depth to latch onto. Much of these themes are tied to some big moral dilemmas that are very relevant today such as racism, feminism, and duty. And just like many of their movies, Zootopia takes at stab at teaching us how to properly handle these situations (shame on you Disney for teaching us!). Regardless whether you learn something or not, Zootopia is an emotionally deep tale that has many levels for all ages to enjoy and perhaps make you tear up in the process.As for the comedy, Zootopia trades in the stupid for a more clever and cute approach. Fans of the DMV will get plenty of witty jabs at some modern trends that include obsession with phones, scamming the system, and plenty of TV references for the media obsessed. Well-timed one-liners and comedic delivery by our voice actors keeps the comedy fun and fresh and had me (and a few other audience members) laughing throughout the film. I didn't notice many kids laughing throughout the movie, most likely due to the lack of the childish humor. Plus side, less repeating of quotes and sounds during the movie. Negative side, they might not be as interested in the movie. Regardless, I certainly enjoyed the writers' wittiness in this film and the fun energy they injected with their comedy without diverging from the theme of the movie.Now lets hit the weaknesses of the film. One thing I was disappointed with was how much of the movie I had seen from the trailers. Disney showed a lot of the funny parts numerous times and felt their effects had waned by then. In addition I felt some of the scenes were not as well done as the trailers had built them up to be, and kind of lackluster compared to the trailer counterparts (such as the naturalist scene). These moments felt unnecessary and barely relevant to the plot and could have been vamped up a bit. In addition I was hoping that the plot twist was a little better executed instead of dropping big hints to give it away. A few other minor complaints include: some overdone comedic ploys and some preachy moments that had me rolling my eyes.Disney once again hits a home run with their animated films. The design of alone is impressive, but the movie is incredibly fun, clever, and has the energy you love. Sure it may not be a film that will keep your kids squealing in laughter, but Zootopia brings many aspects to the silver screen that I think all ages will love. I fully support going to see this movie in theaters and hope you will enjoy the film as much as I did.My scores for Zootopia are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.5Movie Overall: 8.0",842,en,seems disney studio continues partake civil war two animation company today walt disney animation studio put another work entitled zootopia attempt add another oscar worthy film rank hype build looked forward entertained another masterpiece studio yet question worth trip theater may ringing ear going give input help decide answer question therefore let get like every disney movie bet animation excellent zootopia exception cast anthropomorphized animal fluidly move screen human like manner live life throughout fictional city capturing grace dexterity homo sapiens modeled even impressive seeing animal primal state anatomy fully captured spectacular detail animation one part magic zootopia design world amazing perfect blend modernized civilization animal ecosystem zootpia residential section emphasize certain architectural style personify particular mood area e g icy cold tundra front mafia serene yet wild energy jungle villa detail brilliantly colored shaded bringing emotion scene still maintaining whimsical nature disney film see movie certainly see beautiful world stunning design movie enough pull theater let talk story comedy movie next disney always quirky unique idea manage imprint mind make u fall love zootopia main story mystery centered disappearing animal across city mystery established suspense story keeping intrigued throughout tale deep rabbit hole went genius movie though bringing two story fold integrating plot plot character developing moment give character depth latch onto much theme tied big moral dilemma relevant today racism feminism duty like many movie zootopia take stab teaching u properly handle situation shame disney teaching u regardless whether learn something zootopia emotionally deep tale many level age enjoy perhaps make tear process comedy zootopia trade stupid clever cute approach fan dmv get plenty witty jab modern trend include obsession phone scamming system plenty tv reference medium obsessed well timed one liner comedic delivery voice actor keep comedy fun fresh audience member laughing throughout film notice many kid laughing throughout movie likely due lack childish humor plus side less repeating quote sound movie negative side might interested movie regardless certainly enjoyed writer wittiness film fun energy injected comedy without diverging theme movie let hit weakness film one thing disappointed much movie seen trailer disney showed lot funny part numerous time felt effect waned addition felt scene well done trailer built kind lackluster compared trailer counterpart naturalist scene moment felt unnecessary barely relevant plot could vamped bit addition hoping plot twist little better executed instead dropping big hint give away minor complaint include overdone comedic ploy preachy moment rolling eye disney hit home run animated film design alone impressive movie incredibly fun clever energy love sure may film keep kid squealing laughter zootopia brings many aspect silver screen think age love fully support going see movie theater hope enjoy film much score zootopia animation action adventure movie overall,2016-03,449,2.5259187911978453
9,2016-03-05,"2016 has been a so-so year in film thus far. Sure, it's only the beginning of March, but there hasn't really been that knock out film to this point. I enjoyed The Finest Hours and Eddie the Eagle for what they were, but besides perhaps Deadpool, no movie has really been worth seeing more than once. Zootopia absolutely is that film for me. It's the next installment in Disney Animation Studio's resurgence of greatness and it can be enjoyed by everyone. It may be Disney's most colorful film to date, for a few reasons, but it also has the classic Disney moral message for viewers of all ages and backgrounds.Zootopia takes place in a world where there are no humans and animals do everything as if they are humans. They have houses, police forces, and access to our type of transportation. Basically, this is the one film in Disney's canon where fans can't really make the theories that it takes place within the same universe as all of the other films. With that said, I loved the world building that Zootopia was able to establish. In many ways, this is the film I can see Disney making sequels to for several years to come. The characters are well realized and there are plenty of potential directions they can take the story.Right from the opening scene I found myself attached the adorable, Judy Hopps, a bunny who dreams of becoming the first of her species to become a cop. Zootopia takes on many of the unfortunate tropes of our real world but the one most identifiable is discrimination and segregation. So of course Hopps is naturally not taken seriously as a determined officer of the law. The self-referential nature of the film doesn't stop there but I don't think it ever jumps the shark. As noticeable as some of the discrimination and prejudices can be when pointed out by several characters, it ends of serving as a good message to not judge or underestimate people's determinations and dreams.On the lighter side, Zootopia is one of the cleverest Disney films to come out in recent memory. Its constant nods to pop culture including famous films like The Godfather or TV shows like Breaking Bad give the parents more than enough reason to take their kids to the theater. There are plenty of jokes that will fly over kids heads and the humor never gets too silly. It's a great balance that makes an animated kids films so great, and Zootopia is a good example of that.More than anything, it's worth seeing for its fun characters and inspiring message. The voice talent is as good as it has been for Disney in a long time as Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, and J.K. Simmons all do a wonderful job bringing these characters to life. You will get attached to Hopps and her unlikely fox friend, Nick Wilde as they go on a journey to uncover a conspiracy that is plaguing Zootopia. Which brings up another brilliant aspect of this film which is its meticulous plot. Near the end some moments felt contrived and perhaps too far-fetched, but when you have enjoyed a film to the extent to which I had enjoyed Zootopia to that point, it didn't really bother me.When an animated Disney film manages to bring to life several new and exciting characters while also implanting an intricate crime story in between, you know you have a gem on your hands. Zootopia may not be as memorable as some of the greatest Pixar films (hey what films are?) but it does have its fair share of thought provoking moments and endlessly re-watchable funny gags.

Disney definitely put a lot of effort into making this film, and it's surprising to realize that the film was in development for only 2 years, which is rare for an animated Disney film! The film's characters, voice acting, visual style, heartwarming message about overcoming struggles in life such as prejudice and stereotypes are well-made. The film's main character, rabbit law enforcer Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) has since become known the ""anti-Disney Princess"" due to her abilities to break the stereotypes found in most Disney heroines and save her city from horrible crimes. Judy becomes Zootopia's first rabbit police officer, but she is told that she has 48 hours solve a case involving several missing animals. Con-artist fox Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), who is initially antagonistic towards Judy, eventually becomes her partner, and the two learn to respect each other even though they are considered by others to be natural enemies. The relationship between Judy and Nick stands out as one of the best aspects of the film, and I feel that it will teach viewers a lesson regarding diversity and overcoming prejudice.",204,en,zootopia one favorite highly rated animated movie time disney definitely put lot effort making film surprising realize film development year rare animated disney film film character voice acting visual style heartwarming message overcoming struggle life prejudice stereotype well made film main character rabbit law enforcer judy hopps voiced ginnifer goodwin since become known anti disney princess due ability break stereotype found disney heroine save city horrible crime judy becomes zootopia first rabbit police officer told hour solve case involving several missing animal con artist fox nick wilde voiced jason bateman initially antagonistic towards judy eventually becomes partner two learn respect even though considered others natural enemy relationship judy nick stand one best aspect film feel teach viewer lesson regarding diversity overcoming prejudice,2016-03,122,1.9746590180008436
10,2016-03-30,"Zootopia is the newest animated movie from Walt Disney Animation Studios, who have made films like Frozen and Big Hero 6. The film stars Once Upon a Time star Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman, and it's directed by Byron Howard and Rich Moore. Byron Howard directed other Disney films such as Tangled and Bolt, and Rich Moore worked on a couple of episodes of The Simpsons and directed Wreck-It Ralph, one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. So this sounds like a winning recipe.The film is about a rabbit named Judy Hopps (Goodwin) who wants to be the first rabbit cop, so she joins the ZPD (Zootopia Police Department). She's moves from her farming life where her parents and other brother and sisters live to Zootopia. Zootopia is a city that consists of nothing but anthropomorphic animals. She's the new rookie cop who of course gets made fun of mostly because of her size, and the fact that she is a bunny. She becomes involved with a case that involves a missing otter where she teams up with a slick con artist fox, Nick Wilde (Bateman), and it's up to them to solve the case only to find out it's much more than that. So the film becomes a buddy cop film/mystery film, a combination I really like, and seems to the best route to go when making a story like this. It leaves you on your toes and keeps you guessing what's going to happen next.Of course, the animation is phenomenal, like all the other previous computer-animated films made by Disney, but it's also some of Disney's best. The world of Zootopia is already big world, and the background animation is beautiful to look at. I love that Zootopia is divided into different habitats, such as rain forest and tundra. It makes for some breathtaking animation. The character animation is also great. Like the fur on Judy and Nick for example. The fur is detailed and so is their actions. For example, whenever Judy is upset or depressed, notice how her ears would go down, a very nice touch. I can't say anything else other phenomenal animation.Right off the bat, Judy Hopps is a very likable character. She's brave, and cares about the others around her. Then there's Nick Wilde, who's the sneaky con artist fox, who's also very likable, especially after his backstory. Other characters Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a buffalo who's also the chief of police, officer Clawhauser, a cheetah who does nothing but eat doughnuts, and Flash, a sloth who works at the DMV. Trust me when I say, he brings in a lot of laughs. This movie is rich with colorful characters, you lose track because they're so many. But every character is so likable, you wish they have more screen time.I should point out, that it does give an important message about discrimination, a very powerful subject today. This is the reason why I love Zootopia so much. Lovable main characters, incredible animation, and great story that makes this another modern classic from Disney. There is a surprise villain towards the end, but I won't give it away for spoiler reasons. If you want to find out who the main antagonist is, go see it for yourself. This is the perfect movie to take the family to. I would give it a 9/10, but its discrimination message about predator and prey really got me thinking about today's world. So because of that, it gets a 10/10 from me.",586,en,zootopia newest animated movie walt disney animation studio made film like frozen big hero film star upon time star ginnifer goodwin jason bateman directed byron howard rich moore byron howard directed disney film tangled bolt rich moore worked couple episode simpson directed wreck ralph one favorite disney movie time sound like winning recipe film rabbit named judy hopps goodwin want first rabbit cop join zpd zootopia police department move farming life parent brother sister live zootopia zootopia city consists nothing anthropomorphic animal new rookie cop course get made fun mostly size fact bunny becomes involved case involves missing otter team slick con artist fox nick wilde bateman solve case find much film becomes buddy cop film mystery film combination really like seems best route go making story like leaf toe keep guessing going happen next course animation phenomenal like previous computer animated film made disney also disney best world zootopia already big world background animation beautiful look love zootopia divided different habitat rain forest tundra make breathtaking animation character animation also great like fur judy nick example fur detailed action example whenever judy upset depressed notice ear would go nice touch say anything else phenomenal animation right bat judy hopps likable character brave care others around nick wilde sneaky con artist fox also likable especially backstory character chief bogo idris elba buffalo also chief police officer clawhauser cheetah nothing eat doughnut flash sloth work dmv trust say brings lot laugh movie rich colorful character lose track many every character likable wish screen time point give important message discrimination powerful subject today reason love zootopia much lovable main character incredible animation great story make another modern classic disney surprise villain towards end give away spoiler reason want find main antagonist go see perfect movie take family would give discrimination message predator prey really got thinking today world get,2016-03,307,2.4119137289539814
10,2016-04-05,"I dare say this could be my favorite Disney film, ever. Take a PG-13 rated live action cop-drama/comedy mystery action movie, and make it animated, and THEN replace humans with animals, and give all the animals the intelligence of humans. Then, and only then, will you have Zootopia. And that's exactly what the writers did, with a remarkable commentary on current-day political and social issues.Judy Hopps is a rabbit on a farm who dreams big, dreams of becoming a police officer. No bunnies become police officers, because they're small and weak. But Judy doesn't care about people who tell her what she can and can't do. She's determined to make her dreams come true, but winds up smack dab in the middle of a crime conspiracy. She's caught a Fox red-handed with his own life of crime, and gave him the option to help her with the case of the missing animals, in exchange to avoid going to jail. So the Fox and the Bunny have a bit of a romance, yes yes :) Judy is pretty cute You MUST see this movie. Even if you don't like animated films, I have to recommend it. The voice acting, the production and animation, this is very much a visual TREAT. It's perfect, just absolutely perfect.

The film is a much needed break if you are searching for an entertaining yet appropriate movie for both you and kids, then Zootopia would be a perfect choice for you. At first, the plot line of Zootopia may just like many other children's movies that have already been released. 'Two unlikely animals defy social stereotypes and become friends anyway' is something that both you and I have probably seen a million times before. But, when watching Zootopia, the plot is somehow completely different than things that I have seen before. Firstly, there are subtle references to popular culture, that most kids would generally not understand. The character Walter White, from Breaking Bad, was probably the most obvious one, probably included in order to keep adults and teenage generations interested. Secondly, the plot line is a bit more complex than many other children's movie, and the plot has much more to it than the relationship between the two friends. Plot twist, after plot twist, this movie has you thinking constantly, making the ending far from predictable.

It's amazing how such a large production that requires cooperation on so many levels can still be creative, fun and original. The movie is on a qualitative level with the best of Pixar productions (possibly because Pixar man John Lasseter acted as creative supervisor).What I didn't enjoy at all, however, was having the the usual Disney schmaltz about a young girl making it in the Big Apple against all odds whilst fighting for a multicultural society where all animals, and even rabbits and foxes, live together in peace and harmony to the sound of Shakira, into my face.",152,en,actually keen another furry disney pixar movie swayed zootopia amazingly good entertaining many level cuteness nothing else whole mobster subplot mr big godfather shape shrew small mouse amazing large production requires cooperation many level still creative fun original movie qualitative level best pixar production possibly pixar man john lasseter acted creative supervisor enjoy however usual disney schmaltz young girl making big apple odds whilst fighting multicultural society animal even rabbit fox live together peace harmony sound shakira face,2016-08,78,2.9187205606224595

8,2016-04-21,"I have now had 2 viewings of Zootropolis (UK name for Zootopia) in 2D and I was really surprised by just how much I enjoyed it. It was effective in balancing out humour with a serious storyline, packaging it in a way that is presentable to people of all ages. Similarly to many successful animations, the story includes several cameos and pays homage to popular culture and film but includes a deep lying political and ethical theme that drives the plot from beginning to climax.The cast deserve a great deal of credit for providing a uniquely and enjoyably varied set of accents. Jennifer Goodwin's voicing of main character Judy Hopes is the best performance for me as she manages to convey an array of emotion and never goes over the top when great deals of excitement and sadness are being portrayed. I found Jason Bateman's deeper and clear voice favourable for his character Nick Wilde as it made it believable that this was an older and wiser character in relation to Judy.No review can be complete without mention of the quality of the animation and the vast scenery and landscapes that have been created for this film. The merger of each animals unique mannerisms with human ones including standing upright on two feet and complex facial expressions are highly crafted. I would love to see a second film where we spend more time in the locations that did not get much exposure including the desert and ice landscapes.My only criticism of the film is the main theme by Shakira. It will stick itself inside your head and the chorus will be stuck on repeat. The worst part is while the sound of the song fits well with the film, it is rather awful without that context with lyrics that rival Limp Biscuit's My Way for worst written song of all time! (That being said I'm a big fan of My Way)I didn't feel that I missed anything by avoiding the 3D screening of the film as it succeeded in entertaining me due to its high quality story telling.

I'm now looking forward to a potential third viewing which is more than I can say for Batman V Superman; I paid the big bucks for the IMAX 3D viewing and saw a film that has everything it needs to succeed: casting, themes, budget, advertising etc but then makes a dog's dinner of the story!",422,en,viewing zootropolis uk name zootopia really surprised much enjoyed effective balancing humour serious storyline packaging way presentable people age similarly many successful animation story includes several cameo pay homage popular culture film includes deep lying political ethical theme drive plot beginning climax cast deserve great deal credit providing uniquely enjoyably varied set accent jennifer goodwin voicing main character judy hope best performance manages convey array emotion never go top great deal excitement sadness portrayed found jason bateman deeper clear voice favourable character nick wilde made believable older wiser character relation judy review complete without mention quality animation vast scenery landscape created film merger animal unique mannerism human one including standing upright two foot complex facial expression highly crafted would love see second film spend time location get much exposure including desert ice landscape criticism film main theme shakira stick inside head chorus stuck repeat worst part sound song fit well film rather awful without context lyric rival limp biscuit way worst written song time said big fan way feel missed anything avoiding screening film succeeded entertaining due high quality story telling looking forward watch successful good second time around looking forward potential third viewing say batman v superman paid big buck imax viewing saw film everything need succeed casting theme budget advertising etc make dog dinner story,2016-04,217,2.6589545918714133

This is the best movie I've seen in a long time, and I have recommended it to almost everyone I've talked to. It's heartwarming.

8,2016-03-06,"Disney's latest animated feature is smart, funny and beautifully animated. It might look like your standard talking animal fare, but it has a lot going on, with some smart metaphors and a complex story. Zootopia is an enormous city full of anthropomorphic mammals who have evolved to live together in a cooperative society that consists of both predators and prey of every sort - they have long since given up on being enemies. Ginnifer Goodwin plays Judy Hopps, the first rabbit to make it onto the Zootopia police force - though all mammals have supposed equality, prejudices kind of rule their society, and such a small creature has never been able to be in such a position before. Judy is initially given simple duties, but she insists on being more and eventually finds her way into a major investigation of disappearing citizens. She teams up with a con artist fox (Jason Bateman), and the two search for clues. The film introduces a lot to think about; it definitely could get young ones considering things like prejudice, stereotypes and racism, and without ever seeming obvious or preachy. The characters are great and the animation wonderful. I did think the story resolves itself way too easily, like, at a certain point, the filmmakers either hit a wall and decided they had to take a shortcut to the end, or perhaps they were thinking a young audience would be getting bored so they just hand the protagonists the answer to hurry things along. The film still may be above younger audience members' heads - the smallest kids in my theater seemed to grow tired of it quickly.

9,2016-03-17,"Love it. Let me just be honest and say it is the best Disney movie ever since the lion king in the 90s. The first trailer did not raise much attention although I liked the idea behind the set up. The guys and gals from Disney animation studio did their best in creating such a live and vivid universe where civilized animals live together in harmony. There is reference and hidden easter-eggs everywhere and I recommend you watch some YouTube analysis after seeing the movie if you really liked it.So for a Disney movie to be successful, it has to have three key elements. A lovable leading character, a bad guy and an upbeat theme song. ""big hero 6"" ""frozen"" and even ""wreck-it ralph"" all had it. Zootopia had it all and more. One of the things I personally love about Zootopia is that nobody needs to die to put set the good guy/gal backwards (rest in peace Hiro and parents of Anna and Elsa). I mean, it is good for a twist and all but I wish I can get a good movie without sacrificing anyone. This maybe a bad thing for an Oscar-pursuing movie but it is totally fine with a Disney fairy tale. Zootopia fulfilled my wish. The movie itself just radiates positive energy every scene it goes because, well, it is a fairy tale after all.One of the best scenes I love is when Judy the bunny first arrives in Zootopia and hopping to the beats of the theme song ""try everything""(you all seen it in the trailer). It just kept playing over and over after I saw the movie. Judy is such a lovable character that you can easily relate to. You genuinely hope she success in her career and being a Disney production means you know she is going to be. Some may say the plot itself is flawed and no one can reach success so quickly. I would say why not, it is a Disney fairy tale and even in reality this could totally happen.Great plot with little bit twist, amazing voice cast, and stunning picture. Zootopia has all the basics of being a great animation feature film.Another thing Zoopopia aces at is that all its characters who got a line are so vivid. From the police chef ""I don't care"" Bogo to the typical politician type mayor Lionheart. The main characters aside, I love Mr. Big the most cause he sure is the god father and he never really ""iced"" anyone, at least not in the movie.For those who rate it 1 star, come on! It is not a documentary, or a sci-fi or even a drama, certainly not a dark comedy aiming to reflect on our society. It is a fairy tale trying to bring you joy and hope and cheer you up. Reality might be cruel and we might lose faith in what we do after a few set-backs. Maybe the next time you are in trouble or feeling the world is against you, tune in ""try everything"" and picture the first day of Judy in Zootopia, it may not solve your problem but sure will give you the courage to face it.It is going to be a big year for long animation feature films.

10,2016-03-09,"Fresh from Disney is one of the newest largely anticipated release to add to the collection of classics released over the decades. In Zootopia, there is a world full of animals where humans never happened, naturally the animals evolved over the years and formed societies of their own. The actual city of 'Zootopia' is not the only such places as there are multiple smaller towns surrounding the metropolis, Judy Hopps being from Bunny Borough herself, but there is an implicit tone that there are other small communities similar to that one all over the world. Without getting into any plot to avoid spoilers, the overall message of this movie is acceptance and overcoming obstacles. Being set in a fictional world with many different species and backgrounds of animals, a primary focus is dealing with various xenophobic tendencies. Everyone faces certain species-ist reactions and societal views, but being Disney they chose a positive message for the overall tone. Like the old classics such as Robin Hood or The Aristocats, it deals with issues that exist in the real world while not being reminiscent of them. While prejudice and xenophobia do also exist in our world, the problems and feelings found in Zootopia are all their own. Being set in a fiction the films character and plot are all self contained and you don't need to be privy to any particular issues of our time. Personally it was refreshing to see a movie with a clear message of good will without referring to ongoing real world issues which would cloud our judgment or try to over analyse the plot. After seeing it a few times I enjoyed it even more and found the message of moving forward and making the world a better place suitable for all ages, both the young who want to feel good about the world, and the older who can appreciate the absolute hopefulness found in the endearing characters and their relations.

10,2016-03-06,"""Zootopia"" is Disney's 55th full length animated feature. it is directed by Rich Moore, and Byron Howard. it stars Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as a bunny named Judy Hopps, and a fast talking scam artist fox named Nick Wilde.the film takes place in an animated world where predator and prey live together in peace and harmony in a city known as Zootopia. Judy Hopps (played by Ginnifer Goodwin) is the first bunny officer in the Zootopia police department or ZPD. when an otter goes missing she has to team up with a fast talking scam artist fox named Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman) who is a key witness to the crime, in order to solve the case.I'm gonna tell you right off the bat that this movie is Flawless. it is an amazing movie with great characters, a great story, great writing, great jokes, and great animation. it even has lessons about prejudice, racism, and the judgment of other people based on what they are or what they look like. it covers every problem facing our world today and the way the filmmakers did it is perfect, but I'll talk more about that later.The characters are amazing and the way they work off each other is amazingly well done. Judy Hopps is a great female character, as well as Nick Wilde who is a great male character and the way they work off each other is fantastic. Their back stories very well tie in with their character and how they operate in this world from the past to the present. the other side characters are great and have a purpose to be in the story. there is a villain reveal in this movie, and I am not telling you who the villain is because that would be a spoiler but he/she is a great villain with a great diabolical plan. The story is very original and to recall, I don't think Disney has ever done a story relating to prejudice and racism before in their animated features, which is a tough subject to successfully pull off, and they did it very well here. it touched on every subject to seriously talk about that's happening to this world.The Animation is very well detailed, rendered, and animated and the designs don't feel out of place in the world that they live in. it's amazing to watch and beautiful to look at and easy to identify characters with their design. The soundtrack is very well composed as it is written by Michael Giacchino who composed other Disney works like the incredibles and ratatouille.to end off on a high note this movie is one of Disney's perfect animated films that succeeds in every level of creativity. 10/10-5 stars out of 5 Disney's best animated film.",463,en,zootopia disney th full length animated feature directed rich moore byron howard star ginnifer goodwin jason bateman bunny named judy hopps fast talking scam artist fox named nick wilde film take place animated world predator prey live together peace harmony city known zootopia judy hopps played ginnifer goodwin first bunny officer zootopia police department zpd otter go missing team fast talking scam artist fox named nick wilde played jason bateman key witness crime order solve case gonna tell right bat movie flawless amazing movie great character great story great writing great joke great animation even lesson prejudice racism judgment people based look like cover every problem facing world today way filmmaker perfect talk later character amazing way work amazingly well done judy hopps great female character well nick wilde great male character way work fantastic back story well tie character operate world past present side character great purpose story villain reveal movie telling villain would spoiler great villain great diabolical plan story original recall think disney ever done story relating prejudice racism animated feature tough subject successfully pull well touched every subject seriously talk happening world animation well detailed rendered animated design feel place world live amazing watch beautiful look easy identify character design soundtrack well composed written michael giacchino composed disney work like incredibles ratatouille end high note movie one disney perfect animated film succeeds every level creativity star disney best animated film,2016-03,234,2.6594381951148676
8,2016-03-31,"In this great melting pot of creatures and races, in this world without a single human Zootopia is probably the most important story of the year. Although it is set in this fantasy world it is surprisingly down to Earth and real. Whether it's the messages on racism, being prejudice or having dreams it is really quite thought provoking and philosophical.Before discussing the more philosophical ideas I would also like to acknowledge the brilliance in animation. Now, obviously this is Disney we're talking about so it's obviously to the high Disney standard. But the cast is really pretty amazing, Jason Bateman's Nick Wilde just had such a sly sense to his voice which fits perfectly with his character. Then Ginnifer Goodwin as Judy Hopps just was so charismatic and positive. I've always personally enjoyed Ginnifer Goodwin's performance on abc's Once upon a time so to see her land roles such as this was great, as seeing your favourite TV show actors and actresses transition into the big screen is always exciting.There is a point about having dreams in the beginning of the film when Judy's parents are really against the whole idea of her being a cop and tell her about not believing too much about her dreams. Well that was very real world and mature was what I thought, for a kids movie nonetheless. Not to say that I agree with papa Hopps at all, dreams are cool, they drive us.So to this whole idea of racism and the whole prey and predator thing, in modern day society there are always prejudice ideas and labelling. Growing up and being a teenager in Asia you could really feel that whether it's 'us' towards 'them or vice versa. Personally there is always a thing towards 'Black people' within older generations and a real negative vibe towards ghettos. Being brought up with this idea on the one hand and the very open minded international school on the other hand really made me see the shallow mindedness of certain people. But that's no one's fault, I mean it's no one's fault because fear all brews from ignorance and misunderstanding. People have such limited understanding of the 'outside world' beyond what they grew up on people get a really limited idea of how others are like. They get a very narrow perspective, and I guess that's the thing we always have to widen our view so we can get the full picture and not base our ideas on short sighted and limited views.This movie discusses ideas of labelling, how much that could mean to someone and how hurtful it could be indeed. As previously mentioned, it is important to understand each other, but take it to the next level of embracing those differences. We live in a world of diversity much like 'Zootopia' there are people of all difference shape and sizes people of different races and colours, we all have our defining features but we should never forget that we also have our similarities. Take those similarities as a bridge, or an extending hand but then through those similarities learn about the differences. We live in such a colourful world, but if we choose to live amongst the same black and white there is a whole other dimension that we would never be able to see.

8,2016-03-06,"Prejudice is very difficult to root out. (Yeah, this is a review about an animated Disney movie, but why can't a family film also have a more mature message?) Unlike discrimination, which refers to overt acts that society can deal with (mostly) through properly-enforced laws and well-designed public policy, prejudice is an attitude and cannot be legislated away. The word prejudice developed from the medieval legal term ""prejudgment"" and today refers to a wide variety of prejudgments that people make every day, based on someone else's association with a certain group. These are prejudices people often hold for their entire lives – sometimes without even realizing it. Does being a Muslim mean supporting terrorism or being atheist mean lacking morals? Is being short a sign of weakness or being fat an indication of gluttony? Are most black people criminals or most whites racist? Most (if not all) of us would answer ""no"" to all these questions if asked by another person, and would probably feel we were answering honestly. But do our actions or choice of words at other times betray some deep-seated prejudices we may not be aware that we have? Along with being an excellent movie which most people will find entertaining regardless of their age, the animated feature ""Zootopia"" (PG, 1:48) subtly asks these questions to the more mature members of the audience, while carrying important messages to all.Zootopia is a big city in a land where humans don't exist and anthropomorphic animals have formed their own orderly society. Having evolved beyond their primal roles of predator and prey, they all live together in relative peace and harmony, except when jealousy, greed or prejudices raise their ugly heads. (Hey, animals are people too.) One of those walking talking animals is Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a young female bunny who fulfills her much-derided childhood dream of becoming the first rabbit to join the Zootopia Police Department. As Judy leaves behind her parents (Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake), and her 275 siblings, to take the train from rural Bunnyburrow into the colorful big city with its tall buildings and varied habitat neighborhoods, you can easily imagine Taylor Swift's ""Mean"" playing in the background. But the meanness doesn't stop when Judy starts her new hard-won job.When Judy takes her place among the wolves, lions, tigers, rhinos and elephants that she now calls colleagues, they all overlook her (literally and figuratively). Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), a cape buffalo, assigns her parking meter duty, at which she immediately excels, but she wants more out of her job than being a meter maid. She becomes aware of the mysterious disappearance of over a dozen animals from different predatory species around the city and she promises one worried wife (Octavia Spencer) that she will help. Judy develops a lead which takes her to a con-man fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) whom she promptly cons into helping her pursue that lead. The trail of evidence they follow takes them to a naturist club run by a free-spirited Yak (Tommy Chong), to a DMV office run by sloths (a clever joke supported by the voices of Raymond S. Persi and Kristen Bell), to the feared crime boss Mr. Big (Maurice LeMarche), to City Hall to get the help of Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwhether (Jenny Slate) and to a secret medical facility controlled by Mayor Lionheart (JK Simmons). As Judy and Nick figure out what's really going on, they learn some surprising and important things about each other – and themselves.""Zootopia"" really does have something for everyone. The littlest audience members will enjoy the colorful scenery, the variety of animals and the action sequences, and are likely to identify with the undersized main character with oversized dreams. Teens and adults will appreciate the sly references to ""Breaking Bad"" and ""The Godfather"", the presence of Shakira as a singing gazelle known as ""Gazelle"" and the important lessons about fighting to be taken seriously and the damaging effects of prejudice. As well-written, well-animated and well-voiced as this film is, its main strength and importance lie in its messages. Prejudice is shown as self-perpetuating and, when allowed to exist unchallenged, actually able to reverse society's progress in the areas of equality and tolerance. Unfortunately, those lessons, as important as they are, sometimes come off a bit oversimplified – and so central to the story, that it's not quite as much fun as I'd expect an animated film to be. Still, ""Zootopia"" is an excellent family film.

10,2016-03-08,"The buddy cop genre. It's seen a lot of unique takes over the years, but this is certainly one of the most memorable. Our main characters are a police bunny named Judy Hopps (played by Jenifer Goodwin) and a con artist fox named Nick Wilde (played by Jason Bateman). Judy has a tough and no-nonsense attitude while Nick is more careless and manipulative, so these two characters play off each other perfectly. The rest of the casting is perfect. I can't think of a single role that was miscast (I especially love Idris Elba as the police commissioner).The story goes that Judy used to live in a rural town, where she dreams of moving to the metropolin city of Zootopia to become a police officer. The problem is that no one, not even the commissioner, takes a rabbit seriously as a cop. She is given the duty of meter maid and eventually encounters Nick, who later becomes an important source of information during a mysterious kidnapping plot. Although the film has many humorous moments, it also has some very emotional ones, especially during flashbacks. The stuggles that both these characters have to put up with feels very genuine and realistic, much like the problems that we have today with race, religion, and sexuality.The only thing I thought could have used more work was the writing. It's not bad, and there are some memorable lines, but some jokes fall flat (like the Godfather spoof). Thankfully there are a lot more that work than those that don't. The action scenes are a lot of fun very creative, and the film itself is animated beautifully.Do I recommend this film? The short answer is yes. The long answer is that it depends on what you're looking for.

10,2016-02-21,"There is a few times were a movie comes out and i can give it a 10/10 (favourite) rating without having to watch it a second time. But this picture was far too great for me not to score 10/10.Zootopia follows our bunny protagonist Juddy Hopps in her quest for justice, honesty and most of all achieving her dream of becoming a cop, impossible as it may seem due to her size, against all odds and constant warnings from others. As a cop she will meet Nick Wilde, a sly fox con artist that will help her uncover some conspiracy that could potentially ruin relationships between prey and predators.This movie is as smart as a anthropomorphic animal film can be taking advantage of every quality of the animal kingdom (for example the districts of the city Zootopia are ecosystems) while also making some references to pop culture and clever writing. The voice acting is top notch and the animation is by far one of the best out there, with impressive lighting effects and character facial expressions. But the best element of this film is its two main characters and the chemistry between them...yes there is just as much chemistry between Juddy and Nick as there is between Danny Golver and Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon.I fell in love with this movie and i cant wait to see it again. If you are into animation definitely give this a try, it has plenty of adult humor and kids will find the animated characters just riveting.

Zootopia is much more sophisticated and ""deep"" than your average animation flick. It follows a quite complex philosophical theme (are we rational, is there still a wild animal in us?). It's not straight-forward comedy, too. There are laughs and chuckles, but they feel more like the writer's secondary motivation.

10,2016-03-06,"Who says family films only have children to preach to? Well, actually I'm not entirely sure if anyone's ever said that, but it sure sounds like they would though, huh? That debate aside, Disney gets it with its newest installment. Without sounding cliché and trite, Zootopia is literally fun for the whole family.It takes place in a world where animals, both predator and prey, live together in harmony-- except not really. Although things have seemed to change, all the animals still have their reservations and fears about one another. Obviously mirroring a place where our own society is right now, as far as race and religion.The whole movie features various species facing intolerance, while digging into and showcasing possible responses to the prejudices against them--perhaps containing the true depth within this film. The themes are obvious to the adults, but subliminal to the kids. Which is a good thing. It deals with a dark subject matter, and the filmmakers aren't afraid to give us that respective tone either.The main character is Officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny rabbit who is finally living her dream of being a police officer in the big city. But she faces adversity since the job is usually held by rhinos or elephants. She's given a case where she has to find an otter who's gone missing--a mystery that adds another fun feature to an already interesting concept. However, it doesn't come until about 35 minutes in--right when you're starting to wonder to yourself what the setup is for.In a refreshing fashion, the writers aren't talking down to their younger audience. It's funny without being over-the-top and irreverent. When the jokes don't work as well, it's never in an embarrassing way. In fact, there may even be more jokes for the adults in this one. However, there are plenty of aesthetic visuals to keep the children entertained for the full runtimeAnimation alone, Zootopia is beautifully detailed.

10,2017-03-10,"Having seen this film multiple times since first seeing it in theaters last year, I have to say that this is honestly one of the most satisfying films to come from Disney in a long time, not to mention one of the most relevant to the real world. While it does take place in a fictional world populated solely by anthropomorphic animals instead of humans, it's quite clear from the very first scene, that many of the societal issues that plague our world are paralleled, quite cleverly I might add, in the world of Zootopia, regardless of whether it's some ""carrot choke podunk"" like Judy Hopp's hometown of Bunnyburrow or the supposedly progressive, cosmopolitan, city of Zootopia where everyone gets along and discrimination is virtually nonexistent.Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) is an adorable little bunny from Bunnyburrow who has big dreams of being the first rabbit police officer in the city of Zootopia, however her more traditional-minded parents aren't strongly supportive of her ambitions, feeling she would be much better off being a carrot farmer, which I suppose, is the traditional occupation of rabbits in the small rural community in which they live. However, once growing up, she ultimately decides to go for it anyway, and moves to Zootopia to become a police cadet, ultimately succeeding in proving both her parents and society in general wrong, and becoming a full-fledged officer of the ZPD (Zootopia Police Department). However, she still has many obstacles to overcome, as most of the cops in Zootopia, quite believably, are both male and predators, leaving her a small, female ""prey"" animal, seem even smaller than she normally would.In addition to racial prejudice in the form of ""predators"" and ""prey"", there are also nods towards sexism, particularly against females employed in ""masculine"" occupations such as police officers. However, she soon finds herself wrapped up in a mystery involving missing mammals, all predators, who have recently gone missing in Zootopia. Despite initially being forced into being a meter maid by her hard-headed boss Chief Bogo (Idris Elba), she soon finds herself on the case of solving the mystery of the missing mammals alongside a sly, devilishly handsome, con-artist fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman). Unlike the more optimistic Judy, Nick is far more pessimistic, seeing no reason in attempting to dispel the stereotypes surrounding foxes that they are untrustworthy. Despite their differences however, they soon discover that they both need each other more than they ever thought, not only to solve the case, but to learn more about themselves, with their friendship allowing them to face, head-on, whatever biases or prejudices they may hold, perhaps without even realizing it.Overall Zootopia is an extremely impressive film on all levels. The animation and character design is absolutely gorgeous, with insane levels of detail in just about every way conceivable, a real step up from even previous Disney 3-D animated films, from the textures and design of the fur, to the wrinkles and folds on the clothing, and the fact that everything is constantly in motion, just like in the real world. The message and overall themes revolving around prejudice and bigotry is also very relevant in modern day American society, which unlike how many try to claim, is not post-racial. However, the film also works incredibly well as a comedy, mystery, and drama film, seamlessly blending in hilarity and thought- provoking satire with heartrending emotional drama and even some pretty decent action scenes. Zootopia also throws in many clever nods and references to other films, both new and old that only more mature viewers are bound to recognize, thus allowing both children and parents to enjoy the film on different levels.Zootopia shows that a film with cute little talking animals can be more than just a film for little kids, but people of just about any age can watch it and find something to relate to or at least learn from through viewing it.

The story of the main character is so gripping and close to actual reality the film was very relatable as Judy struggles with people accepting her and has to fight for her position.The only downfall to the film was the parts where the animals jumped out and my sister screamed she was that scared and did not want to watch any more.

10,2016-02-22,"I've always admired the Disney films, from the very first of Snow white and the seven dwarfs to their latest instalment of Zootopia. It has a red thread, a theme and vibrant humour throughout the entire film, and it keeps on those values from start to finish.Judy Hopps is a bunny with dreams, big dreams, as she's a bunny with the dreams of becoming an officer, which no bunny has ever been. Despite everyone's attempts of keeping her from it, she goes through it. As an officer, she's looked down at, until she lands her first case, and inadvertently her first ""partner"" in the sly fox Nick Wilde. And together the unlikely partners (despite the fox' will) starts pulling the strings together of the mysterious case of the missing animals of Zootopia.The story isn't sophisticated, but then again, no story from Disney is. This isn't ""The usual suspects"" or ""Lucky number slevin"", but it is a good story and there are some strong themes around prejudice and reaching for your dreams, regardless of what others say. The animations are superb as always, the music lively and the soundscape amazing. The details are good as well, from the long delivery tube to get the coffee delivered to the giraffe to the entire city block dedicated to rodents, there are details all over the place. The creators went to great lengths to make sure Zootopia as a diverse city, stood out as one. I can highly recommend this film to kids and adults alike.

It was funny, it was witty, it was cleverly written and it had a very good message.""Zootopia"" is not the first anthropomorphic Disney movie. Just about every Disney movie gives human qualities and characteristics to animals, cars, planes, etc. This movie was unique in that it united the entire mammal world in one (seemingly) harmonious location. But what looked like harmony from a distance had some underlying ugly but accepted societal norms.Beneath the beautiful exterior was stereotyping and making sweeping statements to encompass entire species. Those remarks could easily have been applied to the same situations we face as human beings trying to live with one another.If the conflict of the movie could be summarized it would've been with one scene. There was one particular discourse between Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit, and her parents. She'd gotten attacked by a fox and her parents' statement was something to the effect that all foxes were jerks.

8,2016-03-21,"In Zootopia, a re-envisioned animal world that is run on civilized mechanics, a rabbit Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) defends her classmates from a bully, decides to go for a course-correction as far as ambition goes and signs up for the police academy. Her world is much like the human one - differences of class, sex and stature are there but that does not stop them from having equal opportunity. A moose can comfortably and confidently co-anchor the evening news with a snow leopard without having to worry about being preyed upon. The food chain hierarchy is maintained but it doesn't stop age-old nature driven adversaries from coming together for the common good. Zootopia's inhabitants don't distinguish between predator and prey, and everyone of them look and talk humanistic even though they retain their original ways in terms of elementary design and movements. The character design in fact, hearkens back to the 1973 Disney film 'Robin Hood'. It's quite a progressive world out there even though there's a hierarchy that is determined mostly by abilities. Considering that this creation comes from the American region it's to be accepted that motor-mouths and 'isms prevail. Like in the real world, size and ability matters most. The big ones like the rhinos, tigers and buffalo a.k.a Capt. Bogo (Idris Elba) get to be responsible for maintaining law and order. Judy is the smaller who rises way beyond her stature to achieve distinction. This film tackles real world issues in an animal friendly manner. Racism, gender bias and other ills are trolled with a feminist zeal here. There's a dark side that references LA Confidential and Godfather with a great deal of punch and pizazz.

8,2016-03-05,"When I first heard about Zootopia (back when it was a 2D film) I was both excited and nervous. The anthropomorphic animal idea has been done before, but never has it been used incredibly well. Robin Hood has animals, but the animals don't live in a world that is as interesting as they are.However, Zootopia happily makes a creative world that is interesting look at and explore (and fortunately, it does explore its world extensively).The greatest element of this movie is the animals and how they are personified. The Water Buffalo is big, massive, tough, and doesn't care about people's issues. The fox (Nick) is sly, clever, and always trying to escape. The rabbit (Judy), is fast, agile, and always ready to act. This makes for some very lively characters and very fun to watch characters. The animation in this movie is gorgeous and the use of depth perception is really good. Almost every shot is beautiful. You can tell a lot of work went into the look of this movie.The story itself is good and uses clever elements (and some social commentary) about how a population full of predators and prey would work. What issues would there be? What could go wrong? A lot of these ideas are explored in this film and it sometimes can feel a little heavy-handed, but for the most part all of the subtext works within the film (though there are a couple of moments where it is blatantly aimed at the audience).My main issue with the film is the final act and the villain. The concept is neat, but the amount of time spent between the villain revealing their-self and them being defeated is about 3 minutes. I know it is supposed to be a mystery until the end, but it didn't seem like a very big pay-off for all of the build-up.Some of the side-issues involve the drama between some of the characters that feels a little forced just for the sake of drama. Should there be some drama? Yeah, but it should be done in a more logical manner.All in all, Zootopia is a very entertaining film from Disney and I'm glad I saw it. The animation is great, the story is pretty solid, and the characters support the movie and make it worth a watch even if you don't like the story or some of the (mildly) preachy moments.",399,en,first heard zootopia back film excited nervous anthropomorphic animal idea done never used incredibly well robin hood animal animal live world interesting however zootopia happily make creative world interesting look explore fortunately explore world extensively greatest element movie animal personified water buffalo big massive tough care people issue fox nick sly clever always trying escape rabbit judy fast agile always ready act make lively character fun watch character animation movie gorgeous use depth perception really good almost every shot beautiful tell lot work went look movie story good us clever element social commentary population full predator prey would work issue would could go wrong lot idea explored film sometimes feel little heavy handed part subtext work within film though couple moment blatantly aimed audience main issue film final act villain concept neat amount time spent villain revealing self defeated minute know supposed mystery end seem like big pay build side issue involve drama character feel little forced sake drama drama yeah done logical manner zootopia entertaining film disney glad saw animation great story pretty solid character support movie make worth watch even like story mildly preachy moment,2016-03,187,2.5896045438592625

9,2016-04-05,"With human warmth, ""Zootopia"" is an emotional and motivational film, with a basic but intelligent humor, and with a plot whose background is understandable for children and suggestive for young adults. The expression ""Never judge a book by its cover"" it is a cornerstone in the structure of the story, as goals related to self improvement. The argument is not quite complex, but is thoughtful but not delves into things that ultimately do not matter in the script, as political and economic aspects.The end is predictable, since from the beginning of the story we know the goals of the protagonist and we know that find a way to reach them, but also shows an unexpected turn when knowing the true villain and his intentions, something similar to what It happened in ""Frozen"" and that in some way perplexes the public. The animation is sublime and very detailed, scenarios are lucid and texture of the fur, skin and clothing of the characters is fantastic with a pleasing level of realism, making evident the great quality that characterizes the CGI of Disney. The low participation of Shakira was somewhat disappointing, considering its extensive mention in the marketing of the film. It includes an interesting social criticism, showing in its outlook a metropolis with a great diversity in its population, whose inhabitants are not spared from being segregated and stereotyped, among which there are those who seek equity and others seeking superiority, and this it is an issue that has caused a stir recently in the United States, the country of origin of the film. Personally, incidental music is one of the most important aspects in a movie, because it gives greater impetus to the emotional aspect of a scene, but the soundtrack of ""Zootopia"" is discreet and easy. The composer Michael Giacchino made a simple job, that although it is not all bad, is not satisfactory, and pales in comparison to its previous soundtrack, which was ""Inside Out"".

9,2016-04-01,"Taking our daughter for an Easter treat, we expected this to be okay, but ultimately just another kids film; how wrong we were.Excellent technically, good story, character-driven, fun plot; enough to be interesting but not too much to lose younger viewers; the animation... Just WOW! From the start to the closing credits, exceptional attention to detail, depth and design. The fur on rabbits being distinctly different from that on foxes and them both being different form the otters', etc. Not just simple things like colour and length, but texture, shine, movement, et al. Weirdly (considering their significance in the film) only the sheep were less well realised than all the other animals.Great social references without force-feeding them to us and being over saccharine or sanctimonious; as can often be the case when family films try to ram-home ""worthy"" messages.

10,2016-03-12,"I normally only use the term ""delightful"" when referring to my 2 year old granddaughter, but this film deserves it. The animated story about a bunny named Judy Hopps who aspires to ""make the world a better place"" (by becoming a police officer in Zootopia) is heartwarming and hilarious.Of course, animation today is breathtaking and this movie is no exception. My wife and I agreed that one of our favorite parts of the show was the train ride into Zootopia - which displays many different ecosystems and wildly different climates. It is spectacular.But this is both a character and message driven story. The main character Judy is lovable, but resolute in her desire to improve the world she lives in. It is wonderful to see her bounce back from betrayals, trials and tribulations. And even when she experiences success, acclaim and fame - her character is tested - and she comes out on top. You really need to see it to know what I am talking about.A number of different movie genres are utilized: a mystery, detective story with homages to ""The Godfather"" and ""Breaking Bad"" are all very cleverly done. The movie also addresses the effects of prejudice and fear - and the way they can destroy relationships.The message for children (and adults) is strong about not giving up your dream - even when all those around you are doubting you - and even trying to make you fail.Humor that adults can also enjoy has become a staple of movies like these - and Zootopia hits a home run in this area. There are many funny lines throughout the movie, but the scene at the Dept of Motor Vehicles made the entire audience laugh out loud. It was my wife's and my favorite.In all the years I have been reviewing movies that I love (or hate), this is the first animated film I have reviewed.

8,2016-03-06,"I did not think Disney had it in them to create something as sophisticated as Zootopia.It's slightly off the Disney formula than you would expect as it talks to the entire audience, not just children about the lessons of tolerance.Zootopia is about a bunny who is told she can not be a cop because she's a bunny, who teams up with a Fox, who this bunny has been told since birth that his kind cannot be trusted, in order to solve the case of some missing animals.It's been a while since I've seen Disney do this style of Anthropomorphism (not since the Disney Afternoon, with such shows as Tale Spin, which this movie reminds me of) , but it is a great way to tell a very mature story about not judging a book by it's cover and feeding it to everyone.Brovo!",142,en,think disney create something sophisticated zootopia slightly disney formula would expect talk entire audience child lesson tolerance zootopia bunny told cop bunny team fox bunny told since birth kind cannot trusted order solve case missing animal since seen disney style anthropomorphism since disney afternoon show tale spin movie reminds great way tell mature story judging book cover feeding everyone brovo,2016-03,60,2.2458248187148913
8,2016-03-07,"Pixar can't seem to do anything wrong, can they? First with Inside Out last year, and back at it again with Zootopia. This movie is a feel good movie that touches the heart, and that preaches that being different is okay. The premise is that a city where animals(both predator and prey) can live in harmony safe from the actual food chain, until something goes horribly wrong which seemingly reverts back to pre-civilized days. Idris Elba leads a cast that entertains you throughout the movie, and makes it so you can't not like this movie. It is beautifully made, and an eye-catcher at that. The cute subtleness of how all animals are different is on a whole new level, especially after the whole ""Chris Rock can make a black joke"" a the Academy Awards just a week ago.

However, with that being said, this movie is a no-doubt must see. Who can say no to Pixar?

9,2016-02-20,"Out of ""Zootopia"" comes one of Disney's cleverest scripts, for the fact it successfully pulls off a new spin on their usual fables. Well, the concept isn't new – an animal buddy cop movie, but in usual Disney animated magic, it is a fun new creation. At the center of this buddy cop movie is bunny Judy Hopps (a wonderful Ginnifer Goodwin), an aspiring cadet who is landed on parking duty, despite being a valedictorian in police academy. But when given a chance to solve a case, she recruits fox con artist Nick Wilde (a smooth-talking Jason Bateman in perfect voice acting mode) to crack it. Yes, one can see the obvious direction this goes. But surprisingly, ""Zootopia"" greatly pulls off the clichés with an abundant dose of Disney Animation Studio's colorful animation (from the creative Zootopia districts to its 3D effects) and its surprising script that, to be honest, contained one of Disney's more adult-oriented dialogue. Secretly, every line and frame is littered with self-referential humor that mostly adults will relate to. (That explains my country's PG-13 rating.) Aside from mature humor, its surprising detour to teach about prejudice is a timely subject. And thankfully, it was not handled with a smack in the gut. All around, ""Zootopia"" may not stick out as a classic, but can rest in our subconscious as one fun, wild ride. So, sticking out for more fun adventures with Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde!",240,en,zootopia come one disney cleverest script fact successfully pull new spin usual fable well concept new animal buddy cop movie usual disney animated magic fun new creation center buddy cop movie bunny judy hopps wonderful ginnifer goodwin aspiring cadet landed parking duty despite valedictorian police academy given chance solve case recruit fox con artist nick wilde smooth talking jason bateman perfect voice acting mode crack yes one see obvious direction go surprisingly zootopia greatly pull clich abundant dose disney animation studio colorful animation creative zootopia district effect surprising script honest contained one disney adult oriented dialogue secretly every line frame littered self referential humor mostly adult relate explains country pg rating aside mature humor surprising detour teach prejudice timely subject thankfully handled smack gut around zootopia may stick classic rest subconscious one fun wild ride sticking fun adventure judy hopps nick wilde,2016-02,142,2.373978111460831
10,2016-04-08,"I always hear things about movies like Zootopia and Inside Out being ""too grown up"" ""not for my 4-5 year old"". None of these people have obviously taken the rating of the movie into account. The movie is rated PG (stands for Parental Guidance), and it is rated PG for it's mild themes, animated violence and some scenes may frighten young children. So, had these people actually paid attention and took these sort of warnings into account, they should have known that for a movie that is rated PG for its mild themes that there will be some things that will be hard for the little ones to understand. There will be scenes that will scare them, and the violence (not that there's much violence in this movie mind you) can be a bit horrific to a young child. It is rated PG for a reason, and therefore makes it obvious that the target audience is for children a bit older than the age of 5 or 6. Your kids will most likely not understand what is going on, why the animals have turned ferocious, why Judy Hopps faces gender discrimination and what some of the policemen-terminology will mean.Now as for me, I enjoyed it thoroughly! I found it to be a very clever, very smart, very witty and a very funny comedy Disney has produced. It is very optimistic and light hearted and VERY imaginative. It tells a very great story of a female bunny rabbit who joins the police force (despite all the negativity she has received for being a female and a rabbit) and teams up with a sly, scamming fox to solve a mystery of a missing otter. It has great back stories of not just the character, but of the society that these creatures live in as well! It has great plot twists that even some adults were shocked about. It's such a fun movie and great for almost everyone (except for those I have mentioned in the first paragraph).So again, for the love of god, these movies have a rating for a reason.

9,2016-04-01,"My REVIEW of Zootropolis Disney's 55th Animated Feature Film. Is it the film we all hoped for from the trailers? Does it hold up to some masterpieces like The Lion King, Aladdin etc. Without having a Prince Charming or Princess and taking this film a completely different way the answer is simply YES. This is a fantastic example of Disney taking a chance and NAILING IT. This has a fantastic lesson for children at the beginning screaming ""CHASE YOUR DREAMS."" Even though Hopps's family was telling her that her dreams of becoming a Cop was unrealistic, she perseveres and that's such a great message. I think it's such a change to see a film marketed towards children to have so many different values and lessons woven into one story. All is not happy and dream chasing for long the film takes a grittier feel in the second act. This is possibly the most racially charged animated feature film that any studio has produced. There are elements of discrimination, prejudice and fear of others who are different throughout this film. Now don't be thinking that this isn't a Disney film as it certainly is with great humour for children. However, not since The Great Mouse Detective have I been so swept up in a Disney mystery. The characters all worked beautifully apart from Gazelle (Shakira), there seemed to be a lot of focus on her but yet didn't move the story along in any way. The sloths however STOLE THE SHOW. To be clear, the movie is very well written and funny I mean some of the self aware references were fantastic. Look out for the Easter Eggs as some of them are genius. There was a period where animated Disney films without the Pixar attachment took a backseat. This may be the beginning of a new era.

8,2016-04-07,"Racism and xenophobia are becoming a bigger problem in recent times. Due to terrorism, many people have the misconception that whole religious and/or ethnic groups are guilty. Most mainstream directors and filmmakers are too scared to talk about this risqué subject matter. Of all movies, a ""cute"" animated movie from Disney for the whole family is delivering these dark themes with excellency.Zootopia is about Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin), a bunny who moves to the metropolis of Zootopia, to become a police officer. She is joined by the con-artist, Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman) who is a fox, normally a natural enemy to the bunny, to solve a case to find a missing otter. The plot on its own is an interesting crime story and will be loved by children.But the actually interesting part of Zootopia is its heavy themes and political messages about prejudice and xenophobia. At the beginning of the film, the movie focuses on the prejudice Judy has to deal with because of her size in contrast to the other policemen and the stereotype of Nick being sly and treacherous, because he is a fox, but throughout the film, it tells more the tension between prey and predators. The city Zootopia is advertised as fair and where everyone lives in harmony. However, it is discriminating against predators for being ""potentially dangerous"". This is a very clever metaphor for the current situation with Islam in Europe, or black people in America.The animation is very beautiful but does not quite reach Pixar level. The characters are very colorful and the screenplay is often funny but also has very serious moments. The score is OK but not recognizable outside the movie. The main song is in my opinion absolutely terrible. I also think that the last fifteen to ten minutes felt a bit forced. There are many pop culture references to, among others, The Godfather or Breaking Bad.Zootopia is a beautiful movie that will enjoy children but will really interest more mature minds, due to its themes and references. The message is clear, but is not forced. The main song is maybe Shakira's worst song (that means very bad).

10,2016-08-11,"Disney has had a slew of animated hits when it came to their CGI productions that were not made by Pixar. With the exception of both of the Planes movies which were...well...crap, you've got movies like Tangled (2010) and Frozen (2013), which hearkens back to the Disney Renaissance days of animated musicals, a la The Little Mermaid (1989) and Beauty and the Beast (1991). Then you've got modern takes on pop culture like the video game-inspired Wreck-it-Ralph (2012) and Big Hero 6 (2014) focusing on superheroes. 2016, however, saw the release of what I think is their best, and most original CGI-animated film to date, and it goes by the name of Zootopia (a.k.a. Zootropolis internationally).The film focuses on a small rabbit named Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) who becomes a rookie police officer in the city of Zootopia, believing that anyone could be anything. However, this is sadly not the case, as she soon finds out with her first day on the job...as a meter maid. However, a female otter stops by the station and explains that her husband is one of 14 animal citizens that went missing, and Judy, determining to prove that she can be a valuable asset, takes on the case, with the only eyewitness to the otter's whereabouts being a fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a known con-artist and all around smart ass that makes Officer Hopps' job more difficult than it already is.At heart, taking away the fact that it's an animated film with an all- animal cast of characters, this is a buddy cop movie in the vein of Rush Hour (1998) and Beverly Hills Cop (1984), just more family friendly. However, there's more to it than being just that alone. The movie is riddled with social commentary about tolerance and acceptance. The beginning of the film where we see Hopps as a child performing a school play about how Zootopia was formed by predators and non-predators leaving their more animal instincts behind and living together to make the world a better place puts this into motion immediately. However, the difference between this and other movies that have similar messages on the aforementioned topics is that this one does it so well that it doesn't sound like it's preaching it in your face and forcing it down your throat, and that's what makes the movie work altogether. It's well- written, and the relationship between Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde becomes more and more believable as the picture goes on.The animation is some of the best I've ever seen from the studio, as if the best aspects of their past animated productions were all present here, proving that when it comes to animated films made in the United States, Disney is still #1 in that department. In all honesty, with all of the lack of imagination coming from the motion picture industry (i.e. pointless remakes), I would love to see more movies like this coming from the big studios like Disney. Out of all the animated CGI productions from Disney this decade, this one is by far my favorite of them all, no question about it. I liked it more than Big Hero 6, Wreck- it-Ralph (which takes second place), and even Frozen.

10,2016-03-05,"First, let me say that this film does NOT preach social justice or feminism. This film is not an allegory for racism/sexism, but is however applicable to them. It is not preachy, nor is it liberal propaganda; far from it, and this is coming from a person who severely dislikes such films.Now let's get to this film. Zootopia is, if you don't know, about a rabbit named Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) who, despite her parents' and peers' opinions, becomes the first ever rabbit police officer in a city called Zootopia, where both predators and prey get along. On her first day, she is assigned a Missing Animal case, and her only lead is a sly fox named Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman).Don't listen to the trailers and plot summaries that make this film seem like a cute talking animal film. This movie is one of the most darkest and mature animated films I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot. Mentioned before, this film deals with sexism (though not as much), drugs, trusting one another, bullying and believing in yourself regardless of the odds, as well as it's biggest moral which is racial profiling and prejudice. And it isn't lightly handled either; the ""species-sm"" (as the director called it) in this film is heartbreaking. A part of the movie was spoiled for me prior to the film, and yet said scene still made my heart malfunction in sorrow. This film is very timely-yet-timeless about how gray the topic of racism actually is in a modern society.Even without making real-life connections, the movie is still amazingly entertaining. The world of Zootopia looks beautiful. The animation in this film is jaw-dropping, and the world is so well thought-out and interesting. You almost get angry when the film doesn't let you enjoy certain landscapes, and that's due to the film's very fast-paced plot that for some reason still finds time in giving us sweet and humble moments. Plus, the story is very well- done, you really feel invested in what's happening with the characters and city, and it's almost like you are experiencing the movie unfold at that moment; like everything that is happening is happening right at that second.The characters of this movie are wonderful. It's supporting cast is very nice, with Idris Elba as a cliché Buffalo cop, J.K Simmons as Mayor of Zootopia, and more. But the spotlight shines on the main characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde. Their relationship stays platonic, however they have better chemistry than most Disney couples. Both of them have their own flaws, and Nick and Judy know this about each other and accept it. They are by no means perfect, and that's why they are so relatable. Plus, they speak as if they are adults. Their is a scene where Judy calls Nick ""very articulate for a fox"" which is very applicable and is surprisingly articulate for an animated film. They speak to each other in a very mature way, which only helps make their bond even more enjoyable to see.And who could forget the voice acting? Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman give absolutely extraordinary performances in this film. I was so shocked to see how they spoke to each other because the voices were so genuine and in the moment. All the characters were great, but the main two were simply amazing.This film has great messages about racism, racial profiling, and prejudice. It captures it all in ways no animated film has ever done. Top it off with great animation, story, and astonishing characters, and you have a film that stands with the animated classics. I highly recommend seeing this film, it is truly amazing.",615,en,first let say film preach social justice feminism film allegory racism sexism however applicable preachy liberal propaganda far coming person severely dislike film let get film zootopia know rabbit named judy hopps voiced ginnifer goodwin despite parent peer opinion becomes first ever rabbit police officer city called zootopia predator prey get along first day assigned missing animal case lead sly fox named nick wilde jason bateman listen trailer plot summary make film seem like cute talking animal film movie one darkest mature animated film ever seen seen lot mentioned film deal sexism though much drug trusting one another bullying believing regardless odds well biggest moral racial profiling prejudice lightly handled either specie sm director called film heartbreaking part movie spoiled prior film yet said scene still made heart malfunction sorrow film timely yet timeless gray topic racism actually modern society even without making real life connection movie still amazingly entertaining world zootopia look beautiful animation film jaw dropping world well thought interesting almost get angry film let enjoy certain landscape due film fast paced plot reason still find time giving u sweet humble moment plus story well done really feel invested happening character city almost like experiencing movie unfold moment like everything happening happening right second character movie wonderful supporting cast nice idris elba clich buffalo cop j k simmons mayor zootopia spotlight shine main character judy hopps nick wilde relationship stay platonic however better chemistry disney couple flaw nick judy know accept mean perfect relatable plus speak adult scene judy call nick articulate fox applicable surprisingly articulate animated film speak mature way help make bond even enjoyable see could forget voice acting ginnifer goodwin jason bateman give absolutely extraordinary performance film shocked see spoke voice genuine moment character great main two simply amazing film great message racism racial profiling prejudice capture way animated film ever done top great animation story astonishing character film stand animated classic highly recommend seeing film truly amazing,2016-03,323,2.6413880613673624
