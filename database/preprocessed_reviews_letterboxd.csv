As timely a Disney movie as we're likely to ever get. With Ferguson, crystal-meth addiction, and a running commentary on the history of racism inherent in the U.S. throughout the 20th century, John Lasseter and his creative team have managed to still remain delightful, witty, touching, visually textured, and fast-paced in this very, very fine film for all ages and tastes. It's quite an achievement, worthy of repeated viewings. Yes, it's that good...and deep, too! Could this be the Inside Out of 2016?

After the massive success and intellectual grandeur of Inside Out last year, I figured it would be a very long time before any other animated film came close.

Even if it doesn't always work and it may not stay perfectly logical, an animation film going for such deeply thematic and topical material has to be applauded and appreciated. So much of this works and makes a great point about social injustices and biases that we all can take away a lot of from it. There is still a lot of humor and lovely animation to boost, and even if it relies on a few too many pop culture references it still works way more often than not.

Disney's ""Fuck you"" to Donald Trump and his supporters.
This is an example of committee filmmaking done absolutely right. Zootopia is stuffed to the brim with visual metaphors, amazingly detailed environments, and beautifully animated characters. The casting is excellent (especially Jason Bateman's fox and J.K. Simmons's lion), the writing is witty. It's a classic approach, using anthropomorphized animals to tell a relevant political parable. It may be wholly unsubtle with its themes, but those themes are as prescient as ever, and sometimes people need messages to be overt in order for them sink in.

*Review: Zootopia*
The last time a Disney feature received overwhelming critical and audience acclaim, such as Zootopia has been getting, was last year's Inside Out (a Disney/Pixar production). I allowed my hopes to get quite high, then was disappointed to find that film just didn't appeal to me as much as it did to others. In fact, I slept through at least twenty minutes of it in the theater. That's not to knock it for people that did enjoy it.… more

This could easily become my favorite movie. It was the perfect balance of humor for kids and more adult humor which a lot of films can't seem to do. The animation was amazing (Disney is always pretty good about that, though, so I'm not surprised) and the characters! They were all so wonderful.

Okay.
This super-energized bunny leaps high and far with impressive characterization, storytelling confidence, wild world-building creativity, and comic agility... and then doesn't quite stick the landing.

Zootopia from 2016 — after years of memes, praise, and endless discussions about it.

This movie is really great and has surprisingly emotional dialogue and performances. The landscapes and world building of Zootopia are crazy; when Judy first enters the city on the train, I had my eyes glued to all of the amazing scenery in the background. Just like how the city of Zootopia is full of variety, the movie is full of several different scenes that all succeed in conveying their intended effect: funny, sad, frightening, and action-packed. Story is great and heartwarming; lots of humor that is tailored to adults as well. All of the animal puns are cheesy but appreciated.

Major contender for animated film of the year.
Zootopia / Zootropolis (dependant upon where you are based) is a roaringly funny, exquisitely animated, utterly heartfelt & surprisingly adult film; one which is brave enough to tackle big, controversial themes, & still manage to be delightfully pleasing for all spectators.
It's zoo-pidly brilliant & I cannot wait to see it again.

Second theme: Everybody is a little bit racist, but if we try we can rise above that. Even bunnies.

The only reason that this isn't 5 stars is because, while I really enjoyed it, I don't feel particularly passionate about it. I think it's a very important movie for Disney to make, and I'm glad to see the reception it's getting (and absolutely deserves), but when the credits hit I didn't find myself going ""oh my god oh my god oh my god"". There really weren't any moments in it that made me feel that way.

That said, this movie is fucking solid. There's nothing I didn't like. For real.

""The more that I reflect on my experience with this film, the better I feel about it. Few big-budget animated productions have the audacity to have so much action, humor and juvenile antics mix harmoniously with mature themes. However, that attempt to combine all of these things works wonderfully in Zootopia. For that reason, I wouldn’t be surprised if this eventually ends up being one of my favorite films of 2016. Any animated film that makes me laugh, well up with emotions, affect my treatment of others, sigh about adulthood and broaden my perspective on society deserves my unequivocal approval.""

Cute, gorgeously animated, and very funny; but it also surprisingly touches on some very adult themes and political issues that are pretty uncommon to hear in children's films.
It's a lot smarter and more ambitious than I was expecting it to be; and some may feel that some of it comes off as too forced, but I mostly found it to be refreshing to see an animated film go for a more adult approach in it's storytelling while still being funny and entertaining from start to finish.
It's a great family movie with great morals, beautiful animation, smart writing, and timely adult themes.

The scene in the nudist colony is one of the most baffling things I've ever seen. It sends my mind whirling and now I have to consider if maybe all these animals neuter themselves for the sake of coexistence and harmony.

Zootopia did not have any reptiles or apes in it. These are two of my favorite animals. However, I still like Zootopia. This is because it was funny and I learned about racism. It was funny to watch these animals talk about race stereotypes, but it also would teach little kids a lesson I guess.
I appreciated that Zootopia set up a universe with rules that made some sort of logical sense within the movie, and then stuck to those… more

The plot is nothing new, and to a certain extent, neither are the characters. But the writing is very original and lends itself to some good social commentary that doesn't get too preachy. At least for the most part. This movie does what a lot of good animated movies do, and creates a world that is interesting and open to A LOT of visual gags. All this being said, I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of animated movies.

When a film containing social commentary (obviously, even) could be enjoyable towards many ages without not only avoiding being codescending but also without reducing the themes of that commentary, you know that it does a lot of things right. It's still flawed, though: predictable plotline that had been done a lot of times and could have done more with a more exciting soundtrack, but overall it's still very enjoyable.
Full review coming soon.

Well-animated and thoroughly engaging. It serves as a solid racism allegory for kids, and I particularly appreciate how it highlights the ability of a demagogue to exploit racial tensions to further his/her own aims. Digging too deeply reveals flaws in the allegory, but I'm not sure it's important for it to be flawless for its target demographic to learn something. It does have a more serious flaw, in that the writers seem to hit a wall about two thirds of the way through the film, and requires a development to come out of nowhere in order to get it moving forwards again.

Though it falls into some big cliches, and is very predictable, Zootopia touches on some issues in society that needed to be discussed at this point in time, and it is beautifully animated. The voice talent is all great, and the two lead characters are very likable, though not incredibly memorable. It has some great humor as well, and I can't deny that I had fun with it. Though it may be very formulaic, Zootopia is very fun and it has the balls to address issues that should be addressed and discussed, so I must give it credit for that.

This film was a great noir, detective/mystery story with all the tropes and twists. And (I guess SPOILER?) it kind of turned into a drug lab bust? I thought Zootopia was wonderful, with all the specialty humor of something like Inside Out, except animal puns and gags instead of emotions and feelings.
I would not be surprised to see Zootopia among the front of the animated pack by the end of the year. What great fun!

Zootopia is the modern metropolis, populated by all manner of mammals. Everyone has an equal opportunity to better themselves, but most resign themselves to their fates. Rabbits are farmers and a lion is Mayor. For Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), her improbable dreams of becoming a police and making Zootopia safer are laughable to most. Bunnies aren't meant to be cops.

Super fun Disney film with a heavier message than usual. Zootopia is probably the cutest film I've seen to tackle racism issues, and though the film ends happily for all involved (this film is a Disney movie after all), the attempt to even take about issues of judging others based solely on where they came from should be respected. The film is ultimately too cute to actually solve and give means of fixing these problems for adults, but if children start learning about the problem and coming up with solutions, then maybe prejudices, in a generation or two, could be a thing of the past.

The coolest part and biggest surprise about ""Zootopia"", at least for me, was that it's really that classic 'cop teams up with criminal with good heart to catch greater evil' story we've seen so many times, disguised as a harmless kids flick that's thankfully made largely accessible enough to both adults and kids.
Some genuinely funny writing, all around great voice acting and wonderful inventiveness in storytelling makes ""Zootopia"" one of the better, clever, and smarter films from Disney animation in a while.

Zootopia is the best Disney Animation movie since 2010's Tangled. Despite me enjoying BH6 and Wreck-It Ralph more, you can't get much closer to a perfect disney movie. One of the few animation movies to focus on social commentary, instead of jokes, which it still has. Without spoiling anything, Zootopia is my favorite (wide release) movie of the year.

The kind of movie you hope every kid sees. Packs quite a hefty message into something a 7-year-old can quickly catch on to. It's also simply a hell of a lot of fun in lots of ways. In a span of 30 minutes, you've seen laugh-out-loud gags, a thrilling foot chase, and the beginnings of a police procedural.

The previews had me nervous: after seeing the same sloth-themed scene a dozen times, I worked up the notion that ZOOTOPIA might just be an excuse to make a whole lot of animal gags. Which it is, but it's also a lot more, and I'm happy to say most of my worries bore no fruit. I liked Zootopia. It's not a transfigurative animated experience, but it's good and timely as is.

""On the animated front, Disney’s Zootopia is reminiscent of hand-drawn studio classics like Robin Hood, The Aristocats or The Rescuers. As far as the narrative side of the equation is concerned, the film plays both like a 1980’s-style buddy comedy like Midnight Run or 48 Hrs. as well as film noir classics like The Big Sleep or Chinatown. It is a deft, hugely enjoyable frolic through a what-if world the likes of which I cannot say I’ve ever seen before, the level of imagination continually on display impressive to say the least.""

The best thing I can say about this movie is that Walt Disney would have been extremely proud of it. Or maybe not considering the movie's message and his *ahem* bias towards people of the Jewish faith.
In normal circumstances, I'd say that this is the best animated movie I've seen since, I don't know, TOY STORY 3, but these aren't normal circumstances. Pixar changed the game 8 or so months ago, so ZOOTOPIA will have to take the silver this time.
I'd be shocked if this doesn't make my end-of-the-year favorites list.

With a new Disney renaissance that didn't take a single wrong step yet, Zootopia is more of a small lump. And dare I say, unnecessary.
It is a highly enjoyable film, very well written and one of their funniest films ever. But it's too safe.
The screenplay is very well written but doesn't explore any new territories. The themes are deja vu, and pretty much spoon fed to the viewer.
But as I said, the sense of humor is at its best and it works really well.
And needless to say, the animation is impeccable.
I guess the studio is putting more effort on Moana.

I swear Zootopia is more for adults than kids. I took my three younger brothers and they loved it but this movie is a total metaphor for our society, racism, and drugs. I absolutely loved it. Great voice work from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. In particular Bateman is perfectly casted as a sly fox. Don't pass on Zootopia, folks. Another great outing with something to say from Disney.

A complex, articulate and ultra-modern anti-prejudice allegory that really elevates the anthropomorphized animal shtick to a new level of usefulness and tact. Who would have thought the classic '80s buddy cop movie '48 Hours' would go on to directly inspire a Disney Animation Studios movie?!

As far as animated animal-based racial parables go, this ain't half bad. It doesn't have the most nuanced insight in the world (and a few too many stereotype-based jokes make the commentary a bit hard to take seriously), but the characters are entertaining and the world-building is so detailed and clever that it's hard to mind.
Question, though: What do predators eat in this universe?

Just further proof why Disney is like 10 times better than Pixar right now. Aside from a rocky opening fifteen minutes, and a bit too long of a runtime, ""Zootopia"" is an absolute blast for both parents and kids with a big heart, some absolutely hilarious moments, memorable characters, deep and relevant themes, and a wonderful voice cast. As soon as they made a ""Breaking Bad"" reference, I knew I pretty much loved this film.

Very pretty and pretty formulaic. The gags land solidly well more than 50% of the time but the movie gets a little too bogged down in the tried and true narrative conventions of the detective genre to rise above in a crowded field of Pixar masterpieces.

Jason Bateman also feels miscast here. He just doesn't bring enough energy into his fox role - this could've been a much more wily, unpredictable character and a little more spark in the vocal performance alone would've gone a long way. He could be a little more animated. Get it? Get it?? Get... get me a gun, I'm done here.

Zootopia is a fun, hilarious and really well made animated film that is great for everybody. The voice acting by everyone was amazing and the animation was stunning. I also found myself laughing a lot, this is a funny film. But, I also love how this film has actual substance. This film can connect to modern society issues and I thought that was really well-handled. Zootopia is so much fun and Disney's best animated film since Wreck-It-Ralph.

From the creators of 'Bolt' and 'Tangled' comes 'Zootopia', an animated picture about a bunny from a small farm in the country with big dreams, and a crooked fox who needed a friend. With some charm and a few funny moments, 'Zootopia' is pretty poignant with its message.
Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman are the two leads--if this had been a live action film it would have been even more fun. They had great chemistry that really came through the… more

The fact that 'Zootopia' is yet another well-animated, well-voice acted, and all-around fun Disney animated film would easily make it a highly recommended film worth checking out just on that idea alone. But then you factor in the film's strongly-written story that combats racism and bigotry in a way that we can all take note from and you have what is quite frankly one of the studio's all-time best efforts.

Zootopia was super cute, hilarious and full of meaning. Strong allegories to racial issues in our society will be the topic of future essays. Basically this movie contains such great messages of tolerance that young people need to hear early. Also kinda neat how it turns into a Police Procedural, I knew nothing about this.
Filled with great vocal performances and gorgeous animation.

Kids will love the cute animals and silly sight gags while older viewers will catch a timely story about acceptance and diversity at a time when the Internet world is at odds about PC culture.
I'm not crazy about the art style but the characters are fun and the world makes sense. Could easily grow on me with future viewings.

Zootopia is an interesting film in a few different ways. It explores very adult themes (for a children's film, especially) of human racism, xenophobia, and sexism.
The benefits of this is a richer narrative with a realistic atmosphere. Adults, like myself, in the theater could comprehend the meaning behind statements such as ""bunnies don't become police officers"" and the whole predators vs. prey dynamic.

Fantastic.
Whoever conceived of and executed the sloth sequence should win best comedy at the 2016 Oscars. You may disagree but that is a perfect scene.
I already talked a lot about this film on Sunday, but for now I'll point out that it's truly compelling for a kids film to dig into race mythologies and coercive power narratives in such a nuanced way.
But I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't see it correctly. The theater played… more

""Zootopia"" was nearly great. It has obvious traits that all Disney Animated Studio films have - it has fluid animation (expensively produced on a blockbuster budget of 150 million) and topnotch voice and heartwarmingly relatable central characters. What may surprise many is just how timely the messages of ""Zootopia"" - a city where anybody can be anybody - are in today's social environment.
However, the screenplay stifles the effectiveness of the deep central messages of prejudice and acceptance and stereotyping… more

1. Zootopia is not a Disney animated movie. It's a metaphor for modern society... that just happens to be animated by Disney. I don't know any other Disney move that starts with the words ""Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust.""

Disney managed to tell a story about following your dreams, the mob, an evil criminal AND made us think about current societal views on race with animated anthropomorphic animals. And they did it in a way that only Disney can: entertaining for both kids and adults.

Disney is just SO good at what they do...
Beautifully animated, engrossing, and carrying a surprising emotional heft only bolstered by its strong, lovable characters, Zootopia is a soon-to-be animated classic with an incredibly delivered, timely message that never overshadows the story's humor or heart.

Captivating and absolutely lovable. This movie feels like a mothe’s hug. It was part of my childhood, but not only that - now it’s part of my life. The lessons I learned from it were never forgotten. We can be anything we want!
Shakira’s presence in the cast was simply wonderful. One of the best movies you can ever watch.

I apologize for the short review, but I don't have much to say about Zootopia. It's a fun animated film with clever commentary, an entertaining story and a cute emotional core. The comedy mostly works, however the emotion doesn't hit as hard. It works for what it tries to be, but I wouldn't call it one of my favorites. The world we're in looks great and I would love to see more. Luckily, we have a sequel now, which I'll… more

I had no idea what the story was going into this movie. I'm glad I didn't because I enjoyed myself a ton in this movie. The film makes fun classics like The Godfather and Breaking Bad. I think a lot of people weren't expecting much from this movie, but as we left the theater, everyone was buzzing and talking about how good the movie was. The voice acting and casting was a smart choice. If you have or haven't, try to stay away from trailers and commercials, you'll have a fun time.

Relishing a creative sense of imagination visually, ""Zootopia"" creates an appealing animated world (through the Animal Kingdom) that successfully emphasized its message about diversity. Even with its plotting and characterizations it triumphed, featuring mortal enemies as allies and turning seemingly-innocent ones as villains. A bold statement indeed, and it knows how to tinker with it: wrapping it up on a crime/mystery thriller vibe and well-crafted sense of humor. The only problem was its emotional baggage that gets wearily imposed but still, this animated feature rocks.

From the creators of Tangled, Bolt and Wreck-It Ralph, Disney delivers a vibrant wonderland of anthropomorphic animals in a contemporary style that tackles prejudice, celebrates the differences in everybody and does so with wit and heart.

Great story, beautiful animation, a real Disney feel to the whole thing. Lots of laughs and lots of feels. The setting is a little absurd but bring your suspension of disbelief and don't ask too many questions about how all these animals can live in harmony in a seemingly evolved state in a world devoid of humans.

I went into Zootopia with expectations that I was almost 100% certain would end up being correct. As usual, because I'm such an absolute genius, they were correct.
The movie was wonderfully animated, the ""animal stuff"" was clever, the dialogue was on-the-nose, and it was just all-around cute.
I laughed out loud many times throughout the movie, and think it succeeded on many levels.
What I didn't expect, however, was for the movie to be so political. Granted, it was political in a very obvious way, almost too much for my taste, but I suppose it's a kid's movie and that's the point.

Disney animation has recently been kind of mixed bag. Although anthropomorphic animals aren't new, they've managed to breathe some life into something that looks adorable and kids-orientated on the surface level but it's really a commentary on racial profiling, sexism, and other forms of social ignorance. Mix it in with some top-notch animation, clever humour, and a well-realized world and you've got yourself great movie. Good job, Disney.

Generously entertaining. The story occasionally suggests it was written by a committee, but the movie, which illustrates appealing worlds and characters is vastly compelling and richly detailed. It could be examined with delight again and again and again. Just be sure to dip out before the end credits wherein Gazelle (Shakira) worms her way into your ear with a celebratory and entirely unnecessary dance sequence. The rest of the movie will charm you.

Disney keeps making better Pixar movies than Pixar does. Whodda thunk it? While this never comes close to the heights of WRECK-IT RALPH, it is still consistently funny, has some likable characters, and some great voice acting. The story does get a bit heavy-handed but its message of inclusion and the ills of prejudice and preconception should hit home for the young set.

Some of the best character animation I've ever seen. A charming way of teaching a lesson about prejudice—but must ALL kids' movies teach lessons? Particularly when such machinations seem to distract the (7!) writers from creating an organic story not overly beholden to plot mechanics?
Still, there is much to enjoy and admire here. I just wish the economics of such films allowed for greater realism, even in a story about talking animals.

Remember how the trailers for frozen depicted it as a fast paced comedy, but it was really a drama at heart with a comedic tone.
Zootopia's also been depicted as a fast paced comedy (excluding the sloths). But it's really a crime/thriller with a comedic tone. Also it's about how racism, prejudice and bullying is bad. Never give up on your dreams. We are all imperfect, but we should never stop us from trying.

Zootopia's messages are pretty obvious: don't judge people based on prejudice, don't fear someone because they're different, etc. But the message is delivered in a nuanced, mature way that I rarely see in family fare. It's never stated outright, and there's no one character that learns the lesson. Everyone in the movie is wrong, and everyone… more

REVIEW WORK IN PROGRESS
Zootopia (or Zootropolis in other countries) is the return of all Disney glory.
Set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) dreams of becoming the first rabbit police officer in the colorful titular city. Her dream later becomes reality, but realizes that being on a police force of big tough animals isn't easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a missing mammal case. Unfortunately, that means she has to partner with Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), a con artist fox to help solve the case.

Disney's Zootopia is a real treat. I was incredibly disappointed with Disney's previous movies Frozen and Big Hero 6, they just felt average and they didn't stick with me at all. But that's not the case with Zootopia, this movie was a ton of fun. Disney’s previous two movies used tragedies as important plot points or even as plot devices. Zootopias emotional core is used to show character development and to get its surprisingly mature messages across. The emotion in this movie is effective and never feels forced. Zootopia is a fast, fun, funny, beautiful and mature animated film which is Disney’s best film in years.

While all animals co-exist peacefully in Zootopia, race-based prejudices are hard to shake off, especially when shady politicians help them festering to pursue their own agendas. Centered on a bunny's determination to succeed as a police officer, and on her awkward attraction for a confidence fox, ""Zootopia"" is a fun-packed detective story about the dangers stemming from social and racial clichés, showing their ever-increasing power as tools of mass manipulation.

There are some wonderful lessons about tolerance in this. But it seems they tried so hard to make EVERY character quirky or memorable, that it's hard to remember any of them.

If not for its first class animation this could've easily been just another buddy cop movie. Animation aside what's even more impressive is the messages inside Zootopia that reach both kids and adults. It's a fun family film but with something to say.

Much, MUCH better than I expected. Honestly, the marketing does this movie a complete disservice. Instead of the kid-focused, gag-driven movie the trailers try to sell, this is instead a smart and timely movie with a strong (and much-needed) message played out in a fun homage to crime movies.
Ample humor, creative world building, a pretty stacked voice cast, excellent animation, and a genuinely interesting (albeit predictable) story. Strongly recommended to kids and adults alike.

The animals in Zootopia come across largely as well-formed characters, which is a huge achievement. By tackling the idea of animal stereotypes head on, we get a little peek into how complicated those behavioral short-cuts can be.
There is more than a little reliance on the classic tropes for sake of jokes, thought. The population of the bunny town is shown on a sign with the numbers going up by the second, etc. But by and large, pre-judgements are called into question at every turn.
Very enjoyable. And even better, very light on dumb humor.

Although Devin Faraci's review oversimplifies some aspects of the film and overemphasizes others, I, for the most part, agree with his assessment: ZOOTOPIA bites off a bit more than it can chew, metaphorically and allegorically, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a) visually intriguing, b) filled with interesting characters, and c) a fun cop movie that is almost certainly lost on children.
Of note: I never thought I'd be agreeing to such a large extent with Mr Faraci.

*FANTABULOUS*
Oh my word. If Disney's animated flicks get any better than they already are, the universe will probably unmake itself in confusion. 'Zootopia' is literally one of the most inspiring films I've ever seen in the theatre, and is already going to be one of the top ten of the year. Wall-to-wall laugh-out-loud humor (including a delicious Godfather spoof) is matched by great characters, a stellar plot, and wonderful, subtle messages. Truly fantabulous. Skip over pretty much everything else in the box office and go see this.

Zootopia has a lot of flaws that, because of a brilliant production design and heartwarming intention, can and should be overlooked. There are problems when a high concept movie that beats you over the head with a nice message has, within it, intentional or unintentional undertones that are just as if not more troubling than the message it is trying to erase.
That said, what a beautiful and fun movie. It's sweet and good hearted and that makes all the… more

ZOOTOPIA surprises. I expected a moving drama about the extraordinary lives of ordinary folks. Instead, I got a dark police procedural that says a lot of progressive things about prejudice. The politics really *are* centerpiece here, with every other scene recalling contemporary discussions about race, crime, poverty, and even biology. You can't overstate how unusual this is; the last mainstream animation to be so patently political was 1973's ROBIN HOOD.

A welcomed chapter in the Disney oeuvre that's certainly boosted by its salient message -- it's probably going to continue being relevant for the foreseeable future. Great voice performances and boldly designed.
But it's quite clear they're really trying to get an extra Oscar nom with that Shakira number.

There was the Golden Age in the 1950's, which brought us such classics as Cinderella, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland and Sleeping Beauty.

Gorgeous animation, memorable characters, a plethora of laughs, and a very relevant and intricately handled social commentary that ultimately makes 'Zootopia' a film geared more towards adults than even the children that accompany you. I simply cannot delve into the commentaries the film explores because it will spoil the adventure the film wants to take you on.

Disney did not disappoint with this film. It left me thinking about how we treat each other based on our biases and our own ignorance. It rare to find a film that tackles so many topics ranging from following your dreams, we shouldn't judge people based on how you believe they would act and understanding that people can change and grow from past experiences. Just to name a few.
I hate spoilers, so I won't mention any of the wonderful jokes from the film.
A must watch!

A feast for the eyes and the mind, it's a small miracle this wasn't just a clever string of observations about the animal kingdom.
Instead, we're treated to a story that's equal parts mystery, buddy cop comedy and social commentary on how our culture systemically views the ""other.""

This is as timely as it is great. It's one of the best animated movies to come along in a very long time. You'll laugh a lot and then you may cry. (I did!) There's some truly great chemistry with Goodwin and Bateman that will make you occasionally forget you're watching an animated feature film.

Zootopia is a very smart buddy cop animated film that underneath it's wonderful characters gives this message of believe that you can be anyone you want to be.
