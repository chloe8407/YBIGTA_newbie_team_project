As one might expect, the trailers that accompanied Zootopia where almost entirely for animated kids films. Of the trailers, one included a poop joke, one included a pee joke, and one included a pun on the word ""ass."" Give this, I can only include that the marketers for kids films conclude that children and parents are gibbering fools. While Zootopia indicates that we can sometimes be fools, we're well meaning ones who can learn to look beyond our own foolishness,… more

Conceptually, this is basically a Dreamworks animated movie. An entire town populated by intricately designed animals? Yeah, that's something they'd do. It didn't feel to me like a regular Disney movie, which is why I was so skeptical going in.
I was right. It wasn't a regular Disney movie. This was a movie about some of the most important social issues, taught to kids through the use of cuddly talking animals. This wasn't a Disney movie that talked down to… more

Disney va muy bien con sus fábulas modelo siglo XXI. Esto es un thriller policiaco, es sobre diversidad y también es furry. The whole package (?).
Esto no tiene que ver con la película, pero la línea de juguetes es genial. Cómprenme todo.

As timely a Disney movie as we're likely to ever get. With Ferguson, crystal-meth addiction, and a running commentary on the history of racism inherent in the U.S. throughout the 20th century, John Lasseter and his creative team have managed to still remain delightful, witty, touching, visually textured, and fast-paced in this very, very fine film for all ages and tastes. It's quite an achievement, worthy of repeated viewings. Yes, it's that good...and deep, too! Could this be the Inside Out of 2016?

After the massive success and intellectual grandeur of Inside Out last year, I figured it would be a very long time before any other animated film came close. Inside Out tackled our views on cognition and emotion in a beautifully creative way, making it not only a spectacle to watch but also somewhat of a crash course in Freudian psychology. In many ways, Zootopia is also an incredibly intelligent and creative film, though its purpose is for a different message—an… more

El mundo de especies en conflicto de Zootrópolis da para columnas sociológicas por los paralelismos con la sociedad humana del 2016, pero en el fondo este regreso de Disney a los animales antropomórficos —el zorro coprotagonista es clavado al Robin Hood de los 70— es una clásica buddy movie sin grandes riesgos ni originalidades, cocinada con el simple fin de entretener. Consigue su noble objetivo casi todo el tiempo, aunque una situación en particular, la visita a una oficina de tráfico en la que trabajan osos perezosos, está demasiado por encima de todas las demás.

Loved it, didn't have high expectations and it doesn't match up with the better offerings of Pixar but this was an entertaining, funny and well judged. A good mixture of jokes that play to the young viewers and plenty of jokes for the adults in attendance. Also dealt with issues of exclusion and prejudice about as well as a disney animation could do.
Some very entertaining in jokes, self referential humor and puns, Idris Elba voicing the police captain Bull was a particular highlight.
A genuine pleasant surprise of a film

Even if it doesn't always work and it may not stay perfectly logical, an animation film going for such deeply thematic and topical material has to be applauded and appreciated. So much of this works and makes a great point about social injustices and biases that we all can take away a lot of from it. There is still a lot of humor and lovely animation to boost, and even if it relies on a few too many pop culture references it still works way more often than not.

Very funny, looks incredible and deals with prejudice in a smart way without ever coming over as preachy, Zootopia is a winner.
The world is also one of the richest Disney has put on screen, and The Godfather and Breaking Bad nods went down a storm in the screening I was in.
In fact, I never knew I wanted a three movie crime saga centred around an artic shrew called Mr Big, but I do.

I feel like ZOOTOPIA was the key for me in unlocking what the current state of Disney Animation is. Over the past 80 years, Disney has continued to evolve both the kind of stories it wants to tell and the tools it uses to convey them. These decades have had their shares of ups and downs, but (almost) every time Disney comes back around with a slight course correction that never takes itself too far away from the initial mission… more

Disney's ""Fuck you"" to Donald Trump and his supporters.
This is an example of committee filmmaking done absolutely right. Zootopia is stuffed to the brim with visual metaphors, amazingly detailed environments, and beautifully animated characters. The casting is excellent (especially Jason Bateman's fox and J.K. Simmons's lion), the writing is witty. It's a classic approach, using anthropomorphized animals to tell a relevant political parable. It may be wholly unsubtle with its themes, but those themes are as prescient as ever, and sometimes people need messages to be overt in order for them sink in.

Zootopia continues Disney's successful streak of great animated features. It has charming lead characters, gorgeous animation, incredible world-building and some very funny jokes. But the most surprising aspect of the film is its effective exploration of such complex themes like racism and prejudice towards others, without feeling preachy and heavy-handed, and instead is used effectively to drive the story forward. Another win for Disney!

The most Dreamworks film Disney has ever made. That's not necessarily a bad thing--it's sinfully cute and rather fun. It just also hammers you over the head with it's (admittedly timely & important) thematic material and is almost exclusively concerned with the aesthetic makeup of Zootopia. Jenny Slate is amazing though.

Zootopia is a great film for children and adults alike. There were a surprising amount of adult references that kids would not get. Most notably to The Godfather, Breaking Bad, Cheech & Chong, and surely many others. They got the parents in my cinema laughing.

*Review: Zootopia*
The last time a Disney feature received overwhelming critical and audience acclaim, such as Zootopia has been getting, was last year's Inside Out (a Disney/Pixar production). I allowed my hopes to get quite high, then was disappointed to find that film just didn't appeal to me as much as it did to others. In fact, I slept through at least twenty minutes of it in the theater. That's not to knock it for people that did enjoy it.… more

Animation & world-building — top tier. Disney delivered one of their best-looking films at the time: insane level of detail in the city, distinct districts, fur textures, lighting — everything is on point. Zootopia feels like a living, breathing place, not just a backdrop.

This movie is really great and has surprisingly emotional dialogue and performances. The landscapes and world building of Zootopia are crazy; when Judy first enters the city on the train, I had my eyes glued to all of the amazing scenery in the background. Just like how the city of Zootopia is full of variety, the movie is full of several different scenes that all succeed in conveying their intended effect: funny, sad, frightening, and action-packed. Story is great and heartwarming; lots of humor that is tailored to adults as well. All of the animal puns are cheesy but appreciated.

This is the first big animated release of 2016, ""Zootopia!"" Disney, at this point, is releasing two, sometimes even three, if we're including Pixar, films a year. They are all pretty awesome too. So whenever Disney Animation releases a film, even sans Pixar, they are well worth all of our time. With recent hits like ""Tangled,"" ""Frozen,"" ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and last years ""Big Hero 6,"" ""Zootopia"" has been on my radar ever since they released the hilarious Sloth trailer last… more

Zootopia is a film that I don't really know how to feel about.
This is a film with fun animation and the weirdest Shakira cameo I think I'll ever experience. It's also slight furry-propaganda and very heavy-handed when it comes to getting messages across.
What works as a noir-ish mystery in its first two acts really stumbles as it segues into the third, but it isn't by any means bad. I didn't love it but my younger brother did, and that's what matters.

Zootopia is a hilariously fun ride, the animation is some of the best to come from Disney and the cast is just excellent in they're roles with Jason Bateman stealing the show. The film feels like a tribute to old buddy cop films while using the animal city to its advantage.

Somehow no one apologizes besides the main lead for how badly the “predators” were being treated and instead forget all about it and cut to the cliched forced happy ending dance sequence.

One of the biggest contradictions I've run into as a film fan is that a lot the most ""fun"" films don't have a lot to say, and most films with a lot to say aren't always terribly fun. So when the most fun theatregoing experience I've had in months also turns out to pack a wallop of a philosophical and emotional impact? Oh man. Happy film fan.

Easy to say it's just a kids film, but its themes are genuinely full of depth and looking at the current state of American politics, I think this film is something that's needed. Watching the 2nd one this afternoon and I hope it's at least somewhat near the same level of depth for what disguises itself as a kids film.

Zootopia / Zootropolis (dependant upon where you are based) is a roaringly funny, exquisitely animated, utterly heartfelt & surprisingly adult film; one which is brave enough to tackle big, controversial themes, & still manage to be delightfully pleasing for all spectators.

First theme: It doesn't matter what you look like. You can do anything, if you are willing to work for it. A bunny breaks down social barriers to become a cop.
Second theme: Everybody is a little bit racist, but if we try we can rise above that. Even bunnies.
Third theme: Demonizing an entire group of people to secure your station is a dick move.

The only reason that this isn't 5 stars is because, while I really enjoyed it, I don't feel particularly passionate about it. I think it's a very important movie for Disney to make, and I'm glad to see the reception it's getting (and absolutely deserves), but when the credits hit I didn't find myself going ""oh my god oh my god oh my god"". There really weren't any moments in it that made me feel that way.

That said, this movie is fucking solid. There's nothing I didn't like. For real.

The movie was very entertaining. Deadpool versi oenyoe dan lebih general, tanpa scene tebas-tebasan kepala. Bagus untuk pengenalan sarkasme bagi anak-anak dan remaja (njirrr, anak-anak dan remaja mosok diajarin sarkasme) meskipun masih dengan bumbu optimisme dan dreamy ala Disney.

""The more that I reflect on my experience with this film, the better I feel about it. Few big-budget animated productions have the audacity to have so much action, humor and juvenile antics mix harmoniously with mature themes. However, that attempt to combine all of these things works wonderfully in Zootopia. For that reason, I wouldn’t be surprised if this eventually ends up being one of my favorite films of 2016. Any animated film that makes me laugh, well up with emotions, affect my treatment of others, sigh about adulthood and broaden my perspective on society deserves my unequivocal approval.""

At its heart, this is a story about optimism running headfirst into reality.
Zootopia opens with a children’s play that efficiently lays out how this world works. It’s playful and funny, but it also quietly establishes the social rules that will shape everything that follows. Judy Hopps grows up believing that hard work and determination can overcome any obstacle, an idea that’s quickly tested.
That uphill battle is clear from the start. Judy’s childhood encounter with a fox bully, and… more

I'm super late to the party here, but this is easily one of the best animated movies of the last 10 years. I'm really behind the ball when it comes to animation in recent years.

Cute, gorgeously animated, and very funny; but it also surprisingly touches on some very adult themes and political issues that are pretty uncommon to hear in children's films.
It's a lot smarter and more ambitious than I was expecting it to be; and some may feel that some of it comes off as too forced, but I mostly found it to be refreshing to see an animated film go for a more adult approach in it's storytelling while still being funny and entertaining from start to finish.
It's a great family movie with great morals, beautiful animation, smart writing, and timely adult themes.
Don't miss it.

A terrific masterstroke of beautiful animation, adorable animals, blistering jokes, and above all else: a poignant, important, multi-layered and timely message. We can all be racist and not know it. We can all be racist and good people. And we can all work together to be better. It's as simple as holding out a hand and being willing to learn.

Entre Intensa-Mente, de Pixar, y Zootopia, de Walt Disney Animation, tenemos dos de las películas más importantes de los últimos años, que sirven para sentarse a ver con los hijos y tener luego un sustancial diálogo acerca de los temas que tocan. La primera, un relato más personal acerca de la importancia de cuidar la salud mental, y la segunda, una historia más amplia acerca de los prejuicios, la diversidad, y la discriminación.

有趣的是不只借用了動物的型，也將物種與人類社會中的身份做對比。不過假如真的是“本性”惹的禍，那這些動物們又該如何？但是既然是迪士尼，最後當然還是有個“人為”而且政治正確的單一兇手就是。

Zootopia has everything I'd ever want in film (well except for time traveling): from a cleverly fantastic fox; to an adorably determined bunny; a neo-noir storyline; other film references; social issues that are kinda relevant today; a pretty awesome score by Giacchino; and just a beautiful film altogether.
It's so cute, and so great... Very Highly Recommended. And guess what? You can bring your children too.

Watched with my kid. Coming off the sequel, this had a lot more originality than I was expecting. The chase that moves into the tiny town is kind of an all-timer of animation. The scene in the nudist colony is one of the most baffling things I've ever seen. It sends my mind whirling and now I have to consider if maybe all these animals neuter themselves for the sake of coexistence and harmony. For reasons I can't explain it manages to be one of the less horny talking animal movies I've seen.

Het is een film die bekeken kan worden door kinderen én door volwassenen (ookal snappen kinderen sommige hilarische stukjes niet) en de linken met de huidige maatschappij zijn duidelijk aanwezig. (Prachtig getoond, met een paar heel rake beelden!)
Maar als ik de zaal buiten stapte, vond ik dit geen kinderfilm. En dat is het ding net!

Zootopia did not have any reptiles or apes in it. These are two of my favorite animals. However, I still like Zootopia. This is because it was funny and I learned about racism. It was funny to watch these animals talk about race stereotypes, but it also would teach little kids a lesson I guess.
I appreciated that Zootopia set up a universe with rules that made some sort of logical sense within the movie, and then stuck to those… more

Zootopia was listed as my most anticipated film of the year. As soon as the I saw the famed ""Sloth"" trailer, I knew this would be something special. Soon enough, the reviews began to fly in about this was an excellent and game-changing film. Proclaimed one of Disney's best in years, I went into the theater ready for an excellent experience.

This was a cute movie that had a few moments of adult-aged humor. It was not as funny as some of the Pixar classics but I can't be too disappointed since this is, after all - a kid's movie. The story seemed to lag in places and fed us the message of ""anyone can be anything"" really really hard. But cute. Enough said.

The plot is nothing new, and to a certain extent, neither are the characters. But the writing is very original and lends itself to some good social commentary that doesn't get too preachy. At least for the most part. This movie does what a lot of good animated movies do, and creates a world that is interesting and open to A LOT of visual gags. All this being said, I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of animated movies.

When a film containing social commentary (obviously, even) could be enjoyable towards many ages without not only avoiding being codescending but also without reducing the themes of that commentary, you know that it does a lot of things right. It's still flawed, though: predictable plotline that had been done a lot of times and could have done more with a more exciting soundtrack, but overall it's still very enjoyable.
Full review coming soon.

Well-animated and thoroughly engaging. It serves as a solid racism allegory for kids, and I particularly appreciate how it highlights the ability of a demagogue to exploit racial tensions to further his/her own aims. Digging too deeply reveals flaws in the allegory, but I'm not sure it's important for it to be flawless for its target demographic to learn something. It does have a more serious flaw, in that the writers seem to hit a wall about two thirds of the way through the film, and requires a development to come out of nowhere in order to get it moving forwards again.

Every time I rewatch this with Jasper, I think “this can’t be as racist as I remember, I was probably being a crabby asshole,” but it’s that racist. You can’t follow the premise as a metaphor for people without immediately running into, like, “some races are naturally more vicious than others.”

First things first, because if I don't get this out of the way now I will keep interrupting the rest of my points to obliquely hint at it-the animation is stunning. STUNNING. Zootopia is a technical marvel.
Not only does it have the much ballyhooed and heretofore unseen level of detail when creating hair and fur, but the landscapes and buildings are rendered so well as to almost be photorealistic. The title city is a marvel all on its own,… more

Funny, heartfelt, and charming Zootopia is a fun and enjoyable adventure with memorable characters and beautiful animation.

Zootopia is hella likable. It has a fun adventure, a lovable duo, vibrant animation, and sharp humor, but what makes Zootopia truly standout, is its ability to serve a greater purpose. The themes in this film are incredibly relevant, however, these themes are addressed in clever ways. At first I was worried I was going to be beaten over the head with these themes, due to the sour opening fifteen minutes. I thought I was heading into The Lorax territory… more

While it may get a little heavy-handed at times with its message, Disney's newest film is nothing short of brilliant. One of the best Disney films of all time. From the in-universe jokes, to the heartfelt moments, to the creative usage of animals-only universe, ZOOTOPIA is a triumph, and deserves all of the praise that it receives.

Now that we're over and done with all of contemporary Disney's mandatory punch-in-the-face moral lessons, perhaps the sequel could center entirely on delivering a harmless, joyful ride with a colorful cast and cracked plot. There were some ingenious moments here that had me outright laughing, something new Pixar/Disney movies don't often succeed with, and honestly those facial expressions of Nicholas P. Wilde were so priceless I could watch a whole feature film of his various smirks. Also, an outstanding job… more

Though it falls into some big cliches, and is very predictable, Zootopia touches on some issues in society that needed to be discussed at this point in time, and it is beautifully animated. The voice talent is all great, and the two lead characters are very likable, though not incredibly memorable. It has some great humor as well, and I can't deny that I had fun with it. Though it may be very formulaic, Zootopia is very fun and it has the balls to address issues that should be addressed and discussed, so I must give it credit for that.

This film was a great noir, detective/mystery story with all the tropes and twists. And (I guess SPOILER?) it kind of turned into a drug lab bust? I thought Zootopia was wonderful, with all the specialty humor of something like Inside Out, except animal puns and gags instead of emotions and feelings.
I would not be surprised to see Zootopia among the front of the animated pack by the end of the year. What great fun!

En más de un aspecto, «Zootrópolis» me ha parecido uno de los productos más redondos y satisfactorios de Walt Disney Animation Studios. Esperaba una buena película y he salido francamente entusiasmado de la sala.

If there's been a driving push from Disney in their latest releases (apart from their dogged refusal to return to hand drawn animation despite my repeated letters) it has been a concerted effort to realign their core messaging, to move it away from the misogynistic, gender role perpetuating, whitewashing, one true love confirming, you're-so-special-it-hurts, you-just-need-to-believe-in-yourself theming.
They've had some qualified successes of late, and managed to do so without taking a hit to their bottom line. From a messaging standpoint,… more

When Disney first introduced Zootopia I had a lot of doubts about this film. The concept of the human like animals has been done multiple times already, so how can this be any different and bring originality to the table? To be honest, Zootopia blew me away in ways I didn’t expect. First of all, this film is beautiful. The animation is almost perfect. Especially the city itself is spectacular, from its different environments to its colorful inhabitants. There is… more

Toujours un plaisir de regarder ce dessisn animé. Je trouve que les détails pour rendre l'environnement adapté à tous les animaux sont fous ! La palette de couleurs pète et rend heureux, les voix associés sont juste et parfois hilarantes !
L'histoire permet de croire en ses rêves et de ne jamais abandonner, même quand on est au plus loin de ses objectifs. Quand on veut vraiment et qu'on se donne les moyens, on réussi forcément à faire des grandes choses et à réaliser ses rêves !

This was not just some dumb kids furries movie. The theme that holds very strong here is racism. Instead of color,it's species. The main character deals with this highly,due to the fact she's a bunny. And no bunny was ever a cop. So she deals with this everywhere. Nick Wilde is another great character here. He is witty,clever and funny. Both these characters are great and their chemistry is spot on. This movie is hilarious and has some great references… more

Zootopia is the modern metropolis, populated by all manner of mammals. Everyone has an equal opportunity to better themselves, but most resign themselves to their fates. Rabbits are farmers and a lion is Mayor. For Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), her improbable dreams of becoming a police and making Zootopia safer are laughable to most. Bunnies aren't meant to be cops.
Zootopia, is easily the best Disney film since Frozen (2013). It's take on discrimination, racial profiling and sexism is profound,… more

The best bit is the sloth, so it's clear why they made it the trailer. For me, the second biggest selling point is the city of Zootopia itself, with its crazy patchwork design and melting pot populace. Racism/prejudice theme is affecting, although didn't The Fox and the Hound go there first? I look forward to the inevitable sequel, when we can get into some real police work.

Super fun Disney film with a heavier message than usual. Zootopia is probably the cutest film I've seen to tackle racism issues, and though the film ends happily for all involved (this film is a Disney movie after all), the attempt to even take about issues of judging others based solely on where they came from should be respected. The film is ultimately too cute to actually solve and give means of fixing these problems for adults, but if children start learning about the problem and coming up with solutions, then maybe prejudices, in a generation or two, could be a thing of the past.

With humor abounding both in its witty screenplay and visual gags, Disney's 'Zootopia' is an incredibly entertaining piece of animation filmmaking that is visually stunning from start to finish.
Story-wise I felt the film lose a lot of steam about 3/4 of the way through and therefore fail to make the perfect landing that makes some of Disney's previous hits genuine classics.

The coolest part and biggest surprise about ""Zootopia"", at least for me, was that it's really that classic 'cop teams up with criminal with good heart to catch greater evil' story we've seen so many times, disguised as a harmless kids flick that's thankfully made largely accessible enough to both adults and kids.
Some genuinely funny writing, all around great voice acting and wonderful inventiveness in storytelling makes ""Zootopia"" one of the better, clever, and smarter films from Disney animation in a while.

Zootopia is the best Disney Animation movie since 2010's Tangled. Despite me enjoying BH6 and Wreck-It Ralph more, you can't get much closer to a perfect disney movie. One of the few animation movies to focus on social commentary, instead of jokes, which it still has. Without spoiling anything, Zootopia is my favorite (wide release) movie of the year.

The kind of movie you hope every kid sees. Packs quite a hefty message into something a 7-year-old can quickly catch on to. It's also simply a hell of a lot of fun in lots of ways. In a span of 30 minutes, you've seen laugh-out-loud gags, a thrilling foot chase, and the beginnings of a police procedural.

The previews had me nervous: after seeing the same sloth-themed scene a dozen times, I worked up the notion that ZOOTOPIA might just be an excuse to make a whole lot of animal gags. Which it is, but it's also a lot more, and I'm happy to say most of my worries bore no fruit. I liked Zootopia. It's not a transfigurative animated experience, but it's good and timely as is.
Part of the movie, despite what I said, really… more

Continuing Disney's ""second-renaissance"" that started with 2010's Tangled, Zootropolis (released under the title Zootopia in North America) looks to continue a largely unbroken thread of Disney animated box-office successes (excepting 2011's under-performing Winnie the Pooh). It follows acclaimed works like Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and Big Hero 6, and while it should reach similar benchmarks to those films financially speaking, it fails to deliver on the entertainment front. Zootropolis is a perfectly perfunctory adventure for youngsters, but despite occasional moments of adult-appeal, the film is far behind other recent Disney features. Read the rest...

Zootopia is a film that doesn't sugarcoat or beat around the bush with serious real world issues. Despite being a fun, cute world (which it is, holy shit the hamsters), it serves as the perfect analogy that makes it easy for kids to understand.

""On the animated front, Disney’s Zootopia is reminiscent of hand-drawn studio classics like Robin Hood, The Aristocats or The Rescuers. As far as the narrative side of the equation is concerned, the film plays both like a 1980’s-style buddy comedy like Midnight Run or 48 Hrs. as well as film noir classics like The Big Sleep or Chinatown. It is a deft, hugely enjoyable frolic through a what-if world the likes of which I cannot say I’ve ever seen before, the level of imagination continually on display impressive to say the least.""

Zootopia has a dumb, simplistic premise that I found really hard to get excited about before it came out. The world feels like, on the surface, a Bojack Horseman with kid jokes, a mock-up of the real world with a bunch of animal puns and silly scenarios. I was pleasantly surprised, then, that there were moments of genuine evocative worldbuilding pleasure in this movie. It presents an absurd premise-animals become conscious like people and build a giant technologically advanced and… more

Zootopia does not have the same commercial impact of the recent successes of Disney, say Big Hero 6 and Frozen, but Zootopia to my view has more to offer especially over Frozen.
Is a fun and entertaining animated film, it is very well made and has an excellent animation, 3D is not so surprising but nothing to worry about.

It's a great idea for a movie. Its execution is brilliant. Its world building is brilliant.

The best thing I can say about this movie is that Walt Disney would have been extremely proud of it. Or maybe not considering the movie's message and his *ahem* bias towards people of the Jewish faith.
In normal circumstances, I'd say that this is the best animated movie I've seen since, I don't know, TOY STORY 3, but these aren't normal circumstances. Pixar changed the game 8 or so months ago, so ZOOTOPIA will have to take the silver this time.
I'd be shocked if this doesn't make my end-of-the-year favorites list.

With a new Disney renaissance that didn't take a single wrong step yet, Zootopia is more of a small lump. And dare I say, unnecessary.
It is a highly enjoyable film, very well written and one of their funniest films ever. But it's too safe.
The screenplay is very well written but doesn't explore any new territories. The themes are deja vu, and pretty much spoon fed to the viewer.
But as I said, the sense of humor is at its best and it works really well.
And needless to say, the animation is impeccable.
I guess the studio is putting more effort on Moana.

a great family movie that works
the story is big point of this movie it is a story driven movie not a comedy driven
movie. which means some younger kids may find it boring at points

but the comedy does work when it happens its a good nice mix of grown up humor with kid jokes

I have to say the only real problem with this one is at points it has bad
pacing but more time than not it is able to get out if that and land on its feet

Incredibly blatant prejudice. We recognize and understand it because not only are they stereotypes about those animals but stereotypes we use against people who are different from us.… more

Laprimera coneja que consigue ser agente de policia tendra que hacerse valer en su primer destino en la comisaria central de Zootopia, donde cualquiera puede ser lo que quiera... Thrller con animales antropomorficos que aprovecha la historia para tratar temas como la discriminacion de genero, el racismo o los prejuicios. Siguiendo el camino de convergencia entre los mundos de Disney y Pixar, la historia abandona el drama para aventurarse en otros generos pero conservando el virtuosismo tecnico. Pese a las continuas referencias, se trata de una pelicula esencialmente infantil.

I swear Zootopia is more for adults than kids. I took my three younger brothers and they loved it but this movie is a total metaphor for our society, racism, and drugs. I absolutely loved it. Great voice work from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman. In particular Bateman is perfectly casted as a sly fox. Don't pass on Zootopia, folks. Another great outing with something to say from Disney.

A complex, articulate and ultra-modern anti-prejudice allegory that really elevates the anthropomorphized animal shtick to a new level of usefulness and tact. Who would have thought the classic '80s buddy cop movie '48 Hours' would go on to directly inspire a Disney Animation Studios movie?!

Tackling difficult subjects for its young audience but succeeding stupendously at making the issues relatable as well as approachable while also offering excellent voice, Zootopia is more complex than it may appear a first, using an old metaphor to talk about a sensitive subject, but doing so with beautiful animation, memorable characters, clever writing, plenty of fresh humor, and still fitting in a good helping of some serious heart.

Per me Zootropolis IT è una delle più alte vette del cinema d'animazione americano, senza se e senza ma.
Il mondo che hanno costruito è semplicemente fuori scala, sia per le tante idee che c'hanno ficcato dentro (talmente tante che un solo film non basta per vederle tutte) che per la cura maniacale per i dettagli e per la coerenza di un setting così complesso. Non era facile, anche perché sugli animali antropomorfi è stato detto e fatto praticamente di… more

La coniglietta Judy Hopps vuole sfidare i pregiudizi e diventare la prima ""preda"" a entrare in polizia, un ambiente per soli ""predatori"". Nel mondo antropomorfo di Zootropolis infatti rimangono ancora latenti gli istinti rapaci delle prede contro predatori, e qualcuno sfrutterà questi istinti.
Rimpiango ancora l'animazione a matita, ma qui la Disney esibisce animazioni sbalorditive, degne dei grandi Maestri del passato.
Ritorno in grande stile anche per Michael Giacchino, che finalmente si diverte e non tenta di fare la grande… more

""Zootopia"" is so damn smart. It's smart in how it depicts an undercurrent message about cultural biases, while having that be told naturally out of the actions of the characters and story. The latter comes first, while the former is a result of it.

People are saying that this movie is an allegory to the racial conditions in America, and are divided on whether or not the representation in the movie is accurate.

Inherent Mice?
As far as animated animal-based racial parables go, this ain't half bad. It doesn't have the most nuanced insight in the world (and a few too many stereotype-based jokes make the commentary a bit hard to take seriously), but the characters are entertaining and the world-building is so detailed and clever that it's hard to mind.
Question, though: What do predators eat in this universe?

Just further proof why Disney is like 10 times better than Pixar right now. Aside from a rocky opening fifteen minutes, and a bit too long of a runtime, ""Zootopia"" is an absolute blast for both parents and kids with a big heart, some absolutely hilarious moments, memorable characters, deep and relevant themes, and a wonderful voice cast. As soon as they made a ""Breaking Bad"" reference, I knew I pretty much loved this film.

Hard to dislike a kids movie that implores them simply not to stereotype other people, but also hard not to be disappointed in how muddled the parable gets when it goes any further past that. Maybe the seven different people with a story credit on this have something to do with that?

Very pretty and pretty formulaic. The gags land solidly well more than 50% of the time but the movie gets a little too bogged down in the tried and true narrative conventions of the detective genre to rise above in a crowded field of Pixar masterpieces.

Jason Bateman also feels miscast here. He just doesn't bring enough energy into his fox role - this could've been a much more wily, unpredictable character and a little more spark in the vocal performance alone would've gone a long way. He could be a little more animated. Get it? Get it?? Get... get me a gun, I'm done here.

Zootopia is saved by the movie surrounding its message. Within each gorgeous, detail-packed, vibrant frame is a gateway to a whole new idea and subtle visual touch.

The fact that 'Zootopia' is yet another well-animated, well-voice acted, and all-around fun Disney animated film would easily make it a highly recommended film worth checking out just on that idea alone. But then you factor in the film's strongly-written story that combats racism and bigotry in a way that we can all take note from and you have what is quite frankly one of the studio's all-time best efforts.

""Zootopia"" is a fun generic disney animation film. The voice acting from the two leads are pretty good. The blending of all the species of animals works well.

The latest animated effort from Disney is the studio's best since Wreck-It Ralph. A combination of buddy cop comedy and hard-boiled film noir with references to classic films.
Kids will love the cute animals and silly sight gags while older viewers will catch a timely story about acceptance and diversity at a time when the Internet world is at odds about PC culture.
I'm not crazy about the art style but the characters are fun and the world makes sense. Could easily grow on me with future viewings.

The good thing about Disney being a formula mill is that they can sometimes take old formulas and blend them into fresh experiences.
This swiftly creates a well imagined world (which leaves you wanting to see more), characters whose traits and intentions you get behind right away, some hit and miss humour, and scrambles them up with a buddy cop movie textured with wild life related visual puns, and Aesop-esque allegorical substance.

I was happy to find out that Zootopia was released one month early in Denmark, much less so to realize that I, at first, had a tough time finding a theater showing it in English near me. Thankfully, I was able to find time to see it in English at the CinemaxX in Copenhagen. Zootopia is the 55th Walt Disney Animation Studios-film, and the first since the release of Big Hero 6 in 2014, which I enjoyed very much.

Disney, I don't know how you keep doing it but somehow you keep churning out spectacular masterpieces. Not only is this film chalk full of references (the Godfather one had me in stitches), clever twists on existing properties but it also had an unexpected message on how we as a society functions. Bordering on 10/10.
THIS MOVIE LIVES UP TO THE FUCKING HYPE.

Zootopia is an interesting film in a few different ways. It explores very adult themes (for a children's film, especially) of human racism, xenophobia, and sexism.
The benefits of this is a richer narrative with a realistic atmosphere. Adults, like myself, in the theater could comprehend the meaning behind statements such as ""bunnies don't become police officers"" and the whole predators vs. prey dynamic. It also preaches an interesting - though pretty common and flat - message of unity and… more

What a timely film.
There's so much to love about this movie. The characterizations were spot-on. I loved Judy Hopps from the get-go; she had the perfect combination of innocent confidence and energy. Characters whose motto is ""You can do whatever you put your mind to"" usually rub me the wrong way, but her child-like (not childish) attitude totally won me over. Meanwhile, I hated Nick Wilde for his smugness and lack of respect as soon as his true colors… more

It's a movie about prejudice, reverse-prejudice, hidden prejudice, preconception, Othering, and privilege, all masqueraded as a talking animals CGI cartoon. Awesome.
Take the American melting pot and conceptions of equality, throw out any reference to race, religion, and gender, and throw in species and predator/prey as classifications, and you have _Zootopia_ ...
... which is _far_ less polemic than that sounds, flowing very naturally as a story about personal gumption, dreams, disappointment, and the complexity of _real life_ ... with… more

The only really bad character is Assistant Mayor Bellwether and she has valid reasons for her actions. Rather the bad things in this movie are like the bad things… more

My Full Review:
""Life's a little bit messy. We all make mistakes. No matter what type of animal you are, change starts with you.""
Zootopia is Disney's latest animated hit. Zootopia is a city where anthropomorphic animals, prey and predator alike, all get along in harmony . But, some animals are still facing discrimination due to untrue stereotypes of their specifics. The film focuses in on Judy (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) who wants to become the first Bunny police cop,… more

I already talked a lot about this film on Sunday, but for now I'll point out that it's truly compelling for a kids film to dig into race mythologies and coercive power narratives in such a nuanced way.
But I can't give it 5 stars because I didn't see it correctly. The theater played… more

""Zootopia"" was nearly great. It has obvious traits that all Disney Animated Studio films have - it has fluid animation (expensively produced on a blockbuster budget of 150 million) and topnotch voice and heartwarmingly relatable central characters. What may surprise many is just how timely the messages of ""Zootopia"" - a city where anybody can be anybody - are in today's social environment.
However, the screenplay stifles the effectiveness of the deep central messages of prejudice and acceptance and stereotyping… more

Nine Things About the Film ""Zootopia""
1. Zootopia is not a Disney animated movie. It's a metaphor for modern society... that just happens to be animated by Disney. I don't know any other Disney move that starts with the words ""Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust.""
2. It's set in an anthropomorphic society (which means animals take on the role of people, and do people things) where a 24-year old rabbit named Judy Hopps gets hired to the police force because the city… more

With plenty of humor and parody to go around, Zootopia manages a pretty steady laugh stream throughout while also managing to keep up a fairly engaging plot (especially for a Disney movie). Plus, the movie is equal parts buddy cop and noir movie, an interesting pairing that surprisingly works in this context. Additionally, Zootopia packs some punch with some beautifully interwoven narrative on racial and… more

What at first appears to be a cute funny movie about animals turns into a great message about prejudice and stereotypes. While still fun and comedic, it gets very serious about how society's prejudices and stereotypes affects the oppressed. The film never talks down to the audience and it is something kids and adults should enjoy. All of the voice acting from the actors was fantastic. Jason Bateman plays Nick Wilde as the charming con man perfectly. He is both… more

Pixar cornered the market on mining emotions, so Disney has had to find some other story aspect to make its diamonds out of, and it seems to have found it with, for lack of a better term, social justice -- a rather ironic and appropriate path given its past of passive princesses and dodgy racism.

Cute, funny and absolutely entertaining, ""Zootopia"" may have been Disney Animation's best film in the past decade. It subtly tackles issues such as diversity and it works with the scenario and premise given. Goodwin and Bateman do some brilliant voice-work and sharing unbreakable and fun chemistry with one another and the gorgeous design of Zootopia and all of the creative ideas brought forward all catch your eye. I do like the message of the film but I feel like it… more

Disney managed to tell a story about following your dreams, the mob, an evil criminal AND made us think about current societal views on race with animated anthropomorphic animals. And they did it in a way that only Disney can: entertaining for both kids and adults.
Let it be known that I laughed so loudly during the DMV scene and also at the Breaking Bad joke.
The only grievance I have with this film is that I can't get that Shakira song out of my head. I will be humming it for weeks.

This movie is only its metaphor and that metaphor while well intentioned is totally simplified to a point of it being offensive. Couple if chuckle worthy bits, but nothing too memorable. Also I wish Disney would do hand-drawn animation more.

Exactly what I want from a modern Disney movie, plenty of timely jokes without being talking down to the audience. It's a flick that knows what it wants to be, and sticks the landing on almost every front. Jason Bateman playing a fox is also really good.

Fa ridere, c'ha il metaforone Disney, è ispirato nelle robe che mette su schermo ed è un buddy cop movie che funziona bene nonostante abbia degli sviluppi piuttosto leggibili. Sopravvive con slancio alla canzone di Shakira e al doppiaggio italiano con la gente di merda, e onestamente non l'avrei detto.

Judy Hopps talks so much about making the world a better place and immediately turns around and writes twice the amount of parking tickets she needs to. I’m sure the struggling single possum mother of 30 is really stoked that she needs to pay 200 zootopence to the ZPD. Judy also immediately racially profiles Nick Wilde upon meeting him, classic police officer activity. 
All bunny cops are bastards.

I had no idea what the story was going into this movie. I'm glad I didn't because I enjoyed myself a ton in this movie. The film makes fun classics like The Godfather and Breaking Bad. I think a lot of people weren't expecting much from this movie, but as we left the theater, everyone was buzzing and talking about how good the movie was. The voice acting and casting was a smart choice. If you have or haven't, try to stay away from trailers and commercials, you'll have a fun time.

Einfallsreich und unterhaltsam, zielt ""Zootopia"" manchmal vielleicht etwas über die Köpfe der Kids hinaus, um auch den Erwachsenen etwas zum Lachen zu bieten, macht aber alles in allem nichts wirklich falsch.
Neben Faultier-Beamten und übergewichtigen Raubkatzen, ist die Message von ""Du kannst alles sein, was du dir wünscht"" etwas zu Standard-Disney-Kram, um gegen andere Filme anstinken zu können, aber manche Klischees funktionieren nun mal - egal wie alt, abgedroschen oder überbenutzt sie auch sein mögen...

Relishing a creative sense of imagination visually, ""Zootopia"" creates an appealing animated world (through the Animal Kingdom) that successfully emphasized its message about diversity. Even with its plotting and characterizations it triumphed, featuring mortal enemies as allies and turning seemingly-innocent ones as villains. A bold statement indeed, and it knows how to tinker with it: wrapping it up on a crime/mystery thriller vibe and well-crafted sense of humor. The only problem was its emotional baggage that gets wearily imposed but still, this animated feature rocks.

Disney proves once again that they're in a new renaissance period with Zootopia. Technically speaking, it's very impressive, as the film boasts ravishing animation and very impressive world building - it definitely shows that the creators paid a lot of attention to detail when creating a world in which animals can conveniently coexist. The film is also a lot more astute than a lot of animated films when its social commentary (and other aspects of its world) are accounted for.… more

From the creators of Tangled, Bolt and Wreck-It Ralph, Disney delivers a vibrant wonderland of anthropomorphic animals in a contemporary style that tackles prejudice, celebrates the differences in everybody and does so with wit and heart. Zootropolis is in no way preachy or thematically ham-fisted but instead utilizes a colourful array of likeable characters and a strong narrative to educate and entertain all ages.

I already know this is a movie I'll be rewatching a few times, not just because it's a great watch, but because of the many great Easter eggs, many of which I'm sure I missed. Lots of jokes for the grown ups to enjoy.
Great story, beautiful animation, a real Disney feel to the whole thing. Lots of laughs and lots of feels. The setting is a little absurd but bring your suspension of disbelief and don't ask too many questions about how all these animals can live in harmony in a seemingly evolved state in a world devoid of humans.

Aside from this is charming neo-noir detective story with a genuine mystery, gorgeous imagery, and some well developed characters living in a very detailed world. Worth your time.

This movie was a total blast.
""Zootopia"" is one of the best times you will have in a theater this year.
All the references (The Godfather) and some surprisingly crude humor will make this an extremely enjoyable watch.
Don't miss it!

I went into Zootopia with expectations that I was almost 100% certain would end up being correct. As usual, because I'm such an absolute genius, they were correct.
The movie was wonderfully animated, the ""animal stuff"" was clever, the dialogue was on-the-nose, and it was just all-around cute.
I laughed out loud many times throughout the movie, and think it succeeded on many levels.
What I didn't expect, however, was for the movie to be so political. Granted, it was political in a very obvious way, almost too much for my taste, but I suppose it's a kid's movie and that's the point.

Disney animation has recently been kind of mixed bag. Although anthropomorphic animals aren't new, they've managed to breathe some life into something that looks adorable and kids-orientated on the surface level but it's really a commentary on racial profiling, sexism, and other forms of social ignorance. Mix it in with some top-notch animation, clever humour, and a well-realized world and you've got yourself great movie. Good job, Disney.
The story follows Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin), a rabbit officer and first… more

Generously entertaining. The story occasionally suggests it was written by a committee, but the movie, which illustrates appealing worlds and characters is vastly compelling and richly detailed. It could be examined with delight again and again and again. Just be sure to dip out before the end credits wherein Gazelle (Shakira) worms her way into your ear with a celebratory and entirely unnecessary dance sequence. The rest of the movie will charm you.

Disney keeps making better Pixar movies than Pixar does. Whodda thunk it? While this never comes close to the heights of WRECK-IT RALPH, it is still consistently funny, has some likable characters, and some great voice acting. The story does get a bit heavy-handed but its message of inclusion and the ills of prejudice and preconception should hit home for the young set.

Pretty goddamn delightful. Didn't expect Disney to combine a serious race relations allegory with a dancing Shakira gazelle, but here we are.
Pitch-perfect voice casting, as always-- I wanted to single out Bateman as being especially perfect for his role, but then I thought, ""Well, so is Slate. And Elba. And Goodwin. And Simmons. And...""
I can't recall the last time I heard kids scream the way they did for Flash the Sloth. They all remembered the ads with the funny sloth. Disney's marketing team, man. Can't beat 'em.

Ich frage mich, zu welchem Zeitpunkt der Antirassismus seinen Weg ins Drehbuch fand. Die zweite Hälfte von Zootopia wirkt auf mich, als wollte der Film sagen: Passt auf, wenn ihr Demagogen wie Trump wählt, dann macht ihr unsere offene Gesellschaft kaputt.
Ich mag die neue Moderne in Disney-Filmen. Nach Frozen ist Zootopia der zweite große Streich, der sich weder vor Pixar noch vor den Klassikern verstecken muss. <3

Given how it's basically an L.A. CONFIDENTIAL riff (with lots more institutional racism), thought I'd like it better. Cute enough.
To clarify, thought I'd enjoy the noirish dabbling but it was too busy being slathered with heavy-handed message. Slate was great.

Walt Disney Animation's latest endeavour [...] is mostly a charming animated allegory for race relations and police brutality using talking animals and aimed at kids. Zootopia features popular, heartwarming themes of following your dreams, overcoming adversity, and cute animals to uncover not only a detective mystery, but also to teach lessons about judgmental attitudes.

Some of the best character animation I've ever seen. A charming way of teaching a lesson about prejudice—but must ALL kids' movies teach lessons? Particularly when such machinations seem to distract the (7!) writers from creating an organic story not overly beholden to plot mechanics?
Still, there is much to enjoy and admire here. I just wish the economics of such films allowed for greater realism, even in a story about talking animals.

Remember how the trailers for frozen depicted it as a fast paced comedy, but it was really a drama at heart with a comedic tone.
Zootopia's also been depicted as a fast paced comedy (excluding the sloths). But it's really a crime/thriller with a comedic tone. Also it's about how racism, prejudice and bullying is bad. Never give up on your dreams. We are all imperfect, but we should never stop us from trying.

I applaud Disney for making a kids movie with an actual message that I think kids will understand without shoving it down adults' throats. Zootopia's messages are pretty obvious: don't judge people based on prejudice, don't fear someone because they're different, etc. But the message is delivered in a nuanced, mature way that I rarely see in family fare. It's never stated outright, and there's no one character that learns the lesson. Everyone in the movie is wrong, and everyone… more

REVIEW WORK IN PROGRESS
Zootopia (or Zootropolis in other countries) is the return of all Disney glory.
Set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, Judy Hopps (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) dreams of becoming the first rabbit police officer in the colorful titular city. Her dream later becomes reality, but realizes that being on a police force of big tough animals isn't easy. Determined to prove herself, she jumps at the opportunity to crack a missing mammal case. Unfortunately, that means she has to partner with Nick Wilde (voiced by Jason Bateman), a con artist fox to help solve the case.

Disney's Zootopia is a real treat. I was incredibly disappointed with Disney's previous movies Frozen and Big Hero 6, they just felt average and they didn't stick with me at all. But that's not the case with Zootopia, this movie was a ton of fun. Disney’s previous two movies used tragedies as important plot points or even as plot devices. Zootopias emotional core is used to show character development and to get its surprisingly mature messages across. The emotion in this movie is effective and never feels forced. Zootopia is a fast, fun, funny, beautiful and mature animated film which is Disney’s best film in years.

While all animals co-exist peacefully in Zootopia, race-based prejudices are hard to shake off, especially when shady politicians help them festering to pursue their own agendas. Centered on a bunny's determination to succeed as a police officer, and on her awkward attraction for a confidence fox, ""Zootopia"" is a fun-packed detective story about the dangers stemming from social and racial clichés, showing their ever-increasing power as tools of mass manipulation.

More actually-good than most ""no, seriously, it's actually good, go see it"" animated studio movies in recent years, but only rarely, you know...really good. The scale of the animals provides the most frequent amusement, especially a run through rodent city and a group of polar bears guarding a tiny rodent wedding. Character backstory is typically belabored.

Wildly inventive use of the 'mismatched buddy' paradigm in a film that interrogates ideas about racial stereotyping in a way that genuinely surprised & excited me. It's also a sly satire on the War On Drugs with a nice little nod to Breaking Bad near the end. Social satire in the guise of kids' entertainment- stuffed with visual & verbal wit. Highly recommended. I would prefer to see it 2D however- the noir visuals are at times too dark for the 3D glasses to handle.

From the first previews, I wanted to see this movie. Disney has been solidly making new classics (finally) and I felt it was high time that I made my way to the theatre to see one instead of waiting for the home release.
The story follows Judy Hops, a rabbit from the country who dreams of moving to the sprawling metropolis of Zootopia and becoming a police officer. There, she's seen as an outsider, incapable of making a difference because… more

There are some wonderful lessons about tolerance in this. But it seems they tried so hard to make EVERY character quirky or memorable, that it's hard to remember any of them. Not destined to be a classic, but better or as good as the likes of Big Hero 6 and Wreck It Ralph. And good to average Disney Animation is typically better than anything else out there.

If not for its first class animation this could've easily been just another buddy cop movie. Animation aside what's even more impressive is the messages inside Zootopia that reach both kids and adults. It's a fun family film but with something to say.
The ""Godfather"" scene was my favorite part and I also appreciated the Emmet Otter reference.

With impressive animation, interesting characters, and a few solid comedic bits, Zootopia remains fun despite the abundance of plot, heavy-handed messaging, and otherwise mediocre writing. The movie, which is often visually stunning, offers a cast of characters filling the background of almost every scene, likening itself to the United States. Disney's clear, quixotic advise resonates amidst the rhetoric this election season: stereotypes are a false, foundational shortcut to blindly judge someone based on appearance, as people from all sorts of… more

Easily the best animated Disney movie in several years. It's got wonderful characters that are funny, endearing, and flawed. This is a movie about learning to understand and accept the differences and faults in one another, and how the inability to do that can cause problems not only on a personal level, but on a societal level as well. The social commentary is thinly veiled, but has the perfect amount of transparency for kids to understand that the ideas of… more

Much, MUCH better than I expected. Honestly, the marketing does this movie a complete disservice. Instead of the kid-focused, gag-driven movie the trailers try to sell, this is instead a smart and timely movie with a strong (and much-needed) message played out in a fun homage to crime movies.
Ample humor, creative world building, a pretty stacked voice cast, excellent animation, and a genuinely interesting (albeit predictable) story. Strongly recommended to kids and adults alike.

The animals in Zootopia come across largely as well-formed characters, which is a huge achievement. By tackling the idea of animal stereotypes head on, we get a little peek into how complicated those behavioral short-cuts can be.
There is more than a little reliance on the classic tropes for sake of jokes, thought. The population of the bunny town is shown on a sign with the numbers going up by the second, etc. But by and large, pre-judgements are called into question at every turn.
Very enjoyable. And even better, very light on dumb humor.

One wouldn’t think that predators and prey would be able to peacefully co-exist, but Disney’s Zootopia posits a world where animals have evolved past their primal instincts to develop a peaceful, idyllic society where anyone can be anything. Growing up on a carrot farm, Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) takes that motto to heart – she dreams of becoming the first bunny to join the ranks of the Zootopia Police Department, and after graduating at the top of her class in… more

Although Devin Faraci's review oversimplifies some aspects of the film and overemphasizes others, I, for the most part, agree with his assessment: ZOOTOPIA bites off a bit more than it can chew, metaphorically and allegorically, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a) visually intriguing, b) filled with interesting characters, and c) a fun cop movie that is almost certainly lost on children.
Of note: I never thought I'd be agreeing to such a large extent with Mr Faraci.

*FANTABULOUS*
Oh my word. If Disney's animated flicks get any better than they already are, the universe will probably unmake itself in confusion. 'Zootopia' is literally one of the most inspiring films I've ever seen in the theatre, and is already going to be one of the top ten of the year. Wall-to-wall laugh-out-loud humor (including a delicious Godfather spoof) is matched by great characters, a stellar plot, and wonderful, subtle messages. Truly fantabulous. Skip over pretty much everything else in the box office and go see this.

Zootopia has a lot of flaws that, because of a brilliant production design and heartwarming intention, can and should be overlooked. There are problems when a high concept movie that beats you over the head with a nice message has, within it, intentional or unintentional undertones that are just as if not more troubling than the message it is trying to erase.
That said, what a beautiful and fun movie. It's sweet and good hearted and that makes all the… more

Es la belleza de lo complejo, la capacidad de adentrarse y buscar en los obstáculos internos y externos. La maravilla de este filme radica en que hace las cosas de buena manera: Es tanto para niños como para adultos, sin ningún remordimiento de por medio.
Sí, me emocioné bien grande. Sí, en muchas ocasiones Judy se vio en el mismo espejo que veía hace años. Sí, fue una experiencia inolvidable. La aceptación de la diversidad, tan simple como especial.

It seems like Disney Animation can't put out a bad movie these days. With its intriguing detective story and mature message, Zootopia hits every note of what moviegoers expect in a good family movie. The world building is rich and filled with gags, so much so that it feels more like a Pixar movie than a Disney movie. Zootopia, the animal city where anyone can be whatever they want, comes alive with infrastructure for all sizes and atmospheric jungle sounds. Sure, we've seen animals act like humans before, but never have they looked so good.

On suit l'arrivée à Zootopia de Judy Hopps une policière qui rêve de faire ce travail depuis son enfance. Cependant, malgré tous ses efforts pour devenir flic elle est reléguée au service de stationnement mais elle arrive à prendre un dossier qui va s'avérer plus grand qu'elle ne le croyait.

Zootopia is probably the most thoroughly entertaining film with a Disney label I've seen since The Emperor's New Groove. It would be so much more successful if it wasn't so by the book, or straddled with an unfortunately mixed message, but it's still a very funny and clever film. The form it assumes as a comical conspiracy thriller is neat and slightly fresh, and the world building at hand here is absolutely killer. Filled with great characters… more

Disney Animation continues their hot streak of late with this superb adventure. Zootopia works on just about every level. It's gorgeous, carefully constructed and genuinely funny.

Disney's success seems to always be cyclical, for whatever reason, seeing golden eras, then slumps, only to be revived by more golden eras. It could be argued that Disney Animation Studios, after seeing a once such Golden Era in the early 90s with such films as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King, saw itself on the decline in the age of Pixar. However, I believe Disney is in the heart of a comeback after… more

When I first saw the Zootopia trailers a year ago, I was not impressed. Even before this week, it seemed like a simple kids movie for kids. However, Disney Animation Studios really stepped it up here, continuing to improve after Frozen and Big Hero 6. I daresay they will begin to rival Pixar soon, because Zootopia is a funny, innovative and cleverly deep film that kids and adults will enjoy.

I knew very little going in so I was intensely surprised at how good this was. The story is solid, there are actual twists, good dialogue and incredibly funny jokes. The jokes for adults were laid in there really well instead of just spelling them out they laid it in as parts of the story. I laughed really hard a number of times. Very fun. Easily my favorite Disney movie of the 2000s.

ZOOTOPIA surprises. I expected a moving drama about the extraordinary lives of ordinary folks. Instead, I got a dark police procedural that says a lot of progressive things about prejudice. The politics really *are* centerpiece here, with every other scene recalling contemporary discussions about race, crime, poverty, and even biology. You can't overstate how unusual this is; the last mainstream animation to be so patently political was 1973's ROBIN HOOD.
Elsewhere, the film has less to show off. It tickles… more

There are some parts that are mindblowingly good (the opening ten minutes, the press conference scene), but overall the rest was just average. I won't be thinking about any of these characters in the future and while the buddy cop mystery is mildly intriguing the twists and turns are not really all that interesting. It's fine kid's entertainment that was almost great.

Disney did not disappoint with this film. It left me thinking about how we treat each other based on our biases and our own ignorance. It rare to find a film that tackles so many topics ranging from following your dreams, we shouldn't judge people based on how you believe they would act and understanding that people can change and grow from past experiences. Just to name a few.
I hate spoilers, so I won't mention any of the wonderful jokes from the film.

A feast for the eyes and the mind, it's a small miracle this wasn't just a clever string of observations about the animal kingdom.

Zootopia is a very smart buddy cop animated film that underneath it's wonderful characters gives this message of believe that you can be anyone you want to be.
