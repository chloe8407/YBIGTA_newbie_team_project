They’ve got a great world established here, and lots of tiny cool details in the backgrounds. We’ve got a very dynamic and fun duo with Judy and Nick.

I'm super late to the party here, but this is easily one of the best animated movies of the last 10 years. I'm really behind the ball when it comes to animation in recent years. I'm not sure how I've allowed that to happen because I love animated movies and find such comfort in so many of them, but I just haven't watched a ton of them. I've always thought about dedicating an entire month to specifically watching animated movies… more

I apologize for the short review, but I don't have much to say about Zootopia. It's a fun animated film with clever commentary, an entertaining story and a cute emotional core. The comedy mostly works, however the emotion doesn't hit as hard. It works for what it tries to be, but I wouldn't call it one of my favorites.

Watched with my kid. Coming off the sequel, this had a lot more originality than I was expecting. The chase that moves into the tiny town is kind of an all-timer of animation. The scene in the nudist colony is one of the most baffling things I've ever seen. It sends my mind whirling and now I have to consider if maybe all these animals neuter themselves for the sake of coexistence and harmony. For reasons I can't explain it manages to be one of the less horny talking animal movies I've seen.

Idk what is the weirdest thing this movie got me thinking about after watch. The multiple amount of questions I had for this world about how sex works for them, or the fact Bellwether feels like she was a foreshadow on Kristi Noem.
This was a good movie tho, a true simple classic from 2010s Disney.

There's never been a rabbit on the cosmopolitan Zootopia city police force, but Judy Hopps has three big advantages - supreme agility, quick thinking, and a never-say-die attitude. Graduating at the top of her academy class, and with a little help from the mayor's request to increase diversity on the force, Judy becomes their latest recruit. But Chief Bogo, who isn't impressed by anything, is even less impressed by a rabbit on the force, and has Judy on parking ticket… more

I mean there's hardly anything new.. in terms of story.
But the references..!! They nailed it on those.
Also the use of metaphors and parallels with real world.. is what made it this good film.
One particular emotional scene (for me).. (I didn't cry) and there were several moments to have a good laugh.
It's short but it definitely took time to get going.. and yes there were few okayish scenes in terms of logic.
Overall a solid animated film. Looking forward to watch Part 2.

I’m not in love with this story, but the jokes are sharp, and I was really impressed with how packed full of life this world is! Every new neighborhood was teeming with details I wanted to know more about. I got the sense that the people who made this movie had a backstory in mind for every character who entered the frame. My kids loved it and we’re all excited to see the second one. Judy and Nick should quit being cops and just become full time popsicle hustlers, though.

Makes me want Arby’s.
Zootropolis is something I honestly would not have watched if 1) Zootropolis 2 wasn’t definitely a front runner for Best Animated Feature this year and 2) my girlfriend hadn’t forced me at gunpoint to watch it. It’s a whatever movie. It went pretty much exactly as to how I thought it would. The world is cute but I seriously don’t understand how the carnivores survive without any sort of meat whatsoever.

This movie is really great and has surprisingly emotional dialogue and performances. The landscapes and world building of Zootopia are crazy; when Judy first enters the city on the train, I had my eyes glued to all of the amazing scenery in the background. Just like how the city of Zootopia is full of variety, the movie is full of several different scenes that all succeed in conveying their intended effect: funny, sad, frightening, and action-packed. Story is great and heartwarming; lots of humor that is tailored to adults as well. All of the animal puns are cheesy but appreciated.

In Brief:
I saw a review of this film once upon a time that called it “Crash for children.” I haven’t seen Crash so I cannot quantify that statement myself; but a poor attempt at discussing racism? Yeah, that’s kinda accurate. It’s a better detective film, and would have been a great one if it was only that.
At Length:
So, time to get heavy.
I’m just going to rip the bandaid off now. This is a pretty harsh chaser… more

This is one of the best noir films ever made. It does amazingly well with a tangled plot and doesn’t get lost. It builds such a rich world and has such metropolitan feel. The message of tolerance and dismantling stereotypes is done well without being too heavy handed. It is so robust and lives when the camera doesn’t focus on the characters. I wish I could plot D&D like this.

At its heart, this is a story about optimism running headfirst into reality.
Zootopia opens with a children’s play that efficiently lays out how this world works. It’s playful and funny, but it also quietly establishes the social rules that will shape everything that follows. Judy Hopps grows up believing that hard work and determination can overcome any obstacle, an idea that’s quickly tested.
That uphill battle is clear from the start. Judy’s childhood encounter with a fox bully, and… more

A: 2016 nostalgia otherwise total cop propaganda. not terrible, wish Judy was a little less polite and a little more commandeering because there was a significant lack of girl power for a kids movie about a girl cop. animation is very fun and cute though. cosy film when you treat it like a kids movie.

Zootopia was a really fun watch and much more than just a kids’ movie. It clearly caters to adults as well, with smart themes and humour that works for both younger and older audiences. The story is easy to follow, engaging throughout, and keeps you entertained while still delivering a meaningful message in a light and enjoyable way.

A modern classic really. A fun, exiting, and interesting family movie. Good music, fun characters and animation. Interesting world building. I got the whole package. And at the same time portraying any sort of racism or presumption in a fun new way.

Zootopia from 2016 — after years of memes, praise, and endless discussions about it.

Good stuff! Really enjoyed this one. Funny, touching, mystery solving, socio-political and visual eye-candy. The CGI animation, character design and world-building are top notch for 2016.
A utopian fantasy world is portrayed, where pretty much everyone gets along no matter what their DNA may dictate. With its many and varied animal species, it’s obviously an allegory for differences like race, identity and cultural background.

Judy Hopps talks so much about making the world a better place and immediately turns around and writes twice the amount of parking tickets she needs to. I’m sure the struggling single possum mother of 30 is really stoked that she needs to pay 200 zootopence to the ZPD. Judy also immediately racially profiles Nick Wilde upon meeting him, classic police officer activity. 
All bunny cops are bastards.

Easy to say it's just a kids film, but its themes are genuinely full of depth and looking at the current state of American politics, I think this film is something that's needed. Watching the 2nd one this afternoon and I hope it's at least somewhat near the same level of depth for what disguises itself as a kids film.
